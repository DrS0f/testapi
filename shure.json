This bass increase is called proximity effect because it occurs when the singer is very near, or proximate, to the mic. Proximity effect can add warmth to the singer's sound, but it can also cause muddiness by degrading the intelligibility of the singer's voice. Proximity effect is a side effect of making a microphone unidirectional.\n\nBecause of proximity effect, a singer must learn the sweet spot of a microphone. The sweet spot is the mouth-to-mic distance where the bass increase from proximity effect is \"just right,\" not so much as to sound muddy, and not too little as to sound thin. Many unidirectional microphones have a restricted sweet spot and this limits how the singer works the mic. Working a mic is the movement of the microphone toward the mouth or away from the mouth so as to modulate the intensity of the singer's projected voice.\n\nSinging artists and sound engineers often desire a microphone with an increased working distance, that is, a microphone that can be used at varying distances from the mouth without distracting changes in the tonal balance. The KSM8 provides this desirable increase in working distance by minimizing proximity effect. The precise Dualdyne mechanics of how proximity effect is minimized is complex and beyond the scope of this document. In simple terms, the rear diaphragm is acoustically transparent to upper frequencies but blocks lower frequencies from reaching the backside of the front diaphragm. This deceives the front diaphragm into acting like an omnidirectional element - which has no proximity effect. However, this rear diaphragm subterfuge does not affect the actual cardioid polar pattern of the mic. So the KSM8 provides the gain-before-feedback performance of a cardioid mic while suppressing proximity effect like an omnidirectional microphone. Neat trick, eh?  \n\nNeutral Frequency Response: The presence peak in the Unidyne III is a high frequency boost in the range of 3 kHz to 8 kHz. This adds a brightness to the sound quality that many find pleasing. But there is another reason for this presence peak; it tends to offset the substantial bass boost from proximity effect found in the Unidyne III. Since the KSM8 has less proximity effect, a significant presence peak is not required. This will appeal to artists and sound engineers who prefer a sound that is more neutral\u2026 less bright. The minimized presence peak provides a perceived increase in bass response when the artist is farther away from the KSM8 and also reduces acoustic feedback issues in the 3 kHz to 8 kHz frequency band.  \n\nUniform Cardioid Polar Pattern: The KSM8 has a more consistent [uniform] cardioid polar pattern than the Unidyne III. The heart shape pattern of the KSM8 remains nearly the same at 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2.5 kHz, and 9 kHz.  Only at 6.5 kHz does the pattern transform to a shape similar to a supercardioid. This uniformity of the KSM8 cardioid pattern offers better gain-before-feedback when used for sound reinforcement. It also improves the vocal clarity heard in stage monitors and in-ear monitors.\n\nDent Resistant Grille: The KSM8 grille is fabricated from hardened carbon steel. Hardening carbon steel causes the molecular structure to crystallize, similar to the way coal changes to diamond under the heat and pressure within the earth. The KSM8 grille is virtually immune to the rough handling and physical abuse which occur daily in a professional setting.\n\nReduced Plosives: Commonly called P-popping, a plosive is a blast of air when certain letters are pronounced; P, B, and T are the worst culprits. Try it yourself. With fingers point upward, place your palm three inches in front of your mouth, and say: \"Bob. Peter. Tom.\" Feel the blast of air? That is a plosive. When a plosive combines with the proximity effect of a unidirectional microphone, the result is an ugly audible \"pop.\"  As the KSM8 has substantially less proximity effect, the end result is reduced P-popping. The improvement is a 6 dB reduction (at 100 Hz) compared to the Unidyne III.\n\nImproved Moisture Resistance: The KSM8 grill is lined with water-resistant, hydrophobic fabric that also reduces wind noise and plosives. In addition, the passive rear diaphragm prevents water from reaching the internal acoustic chambers.  Though the KSM8 is not water-proof, it is extremely resistant to damage from condensation, precipitation, and other forms of invasive moisture.\n\nIncreased Output Level: The KSM8 has a new magnetic circuit design. Compared to the Unidyne III, the KSM8 Dualdyne output signal is 3 dB greater, providing an improved signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nPneumatic Shock Mount: The shock mount concept from the Unidyne III has been improved to keep handling noise to a minimum. The KSM8 diaphragm remains nearly motionless no matter the direction of the physical vibration - up, down, left, or right.\n\nNote well that the KSM8 is not a replacement for the SM58 or the Beta 58A. The KSM8 is a new microphone choice for high-end touring sound reinforcement professionals. So, where might the KSM8 not be the best choice?\nA venue where the monitor engineer requires maximum stage volume from floor monitors. The Beta 58A or KSM9HS (set to hyper-cardioid) may be more appropriate because of the tighter polar pattern.\nA venue that hosts artists with inadvisable mic technique, like cupping the grille of the mic. The KSM9HS (set to hyper-cardioid) may be more appropriate as it is tolerates a wide variety of microphone techniques.  \nA small/medium sized venue where gain-before-feedback is a challenge. Or a venue that hosts new artists every night and requires the most versatile model of microphone. Such a venue may be better off with the SM58 or Beta 58A.\nAn artist or sound engineer who prefers the sound quality of the SM58 or Beta 58A. It is not unusual for artists to have honed their signature sound with a specific model; thus there is no motivation/need for a microphone change.\n\nIn 1959, the Unidyne III brought revolutionary features to the sound reinforcement market. In 2016, the innovative KSM8 does the same with its leading-edge advancements. When employed to solve the specific issues of high-end touring sound, the KSM8 provides outstanding performance.\n\nFor additional information, please refer to the Dualdyne White Paper (pdf)."}, {"question": "We currently have several wireless systems in the VHF range (170 - 200 MHZ).

(3) I've seen mic cables advertised that are 2 conductor but have XLR on both ends - how do these carry balanced signals (I thought you needed 3 conductors). How do I identify proper cables? Thanks.", "answer": "Answer\nThe BG4.1 always has a balanced output, regardless of power source. It is the cable that unbalances the signal. Anytime the BG4.1 receives phantom power, it will use it instead of the battery. You do not need to remove the battery when using phantom. Nor does the battery need to be installed when phantom power is present.\n\nPhantom power does require 3 conductors.

The SM7B contains internal shock mounting, so external shock mounts are not required. However, higher-end boom arms do minimize the amount of desk noise transmitted to the mic.\n\nTraditionally, the SM7B and MV7 are mounted to a boom arm so that the mic can be positioned in front of a person sitting in a radio or podcast studio.

There is an adaptor included to connect to a 3/8\"-16 (European-style) mounts. Both mounts require a male end on the stand. For the SM7B to fasten tightly to a mic stand, there must be 7 mm (3/8\") of external (male) thread exposed on the mic stand. If there is a retaining ring on the mic stand thread, remove it and this will typically expose about 10 mm of male thread. \n\nNote that the XLR connector on the SM7B is close to the threaded mic mount, so verify that the cable will still attach with your choice of mic mount.\n\nThe MV7 is also available in three bundles which include a desktop tripod stand:\nMV7 SRH440A Tripod Bundle\nMV7 Kit + SE215 Pro Earphones\nMV7 Kit + Wireless Headphone Bundle\nIf you are interested in purchasing the Manfrotto Tripod separately, please see this article: I need a desktop tripod for my MV7"}, {"question": "I have Shure earphones / earbuds that I want to get custom molds for.

Will they attenuate the signal down by 50db if I switch both attenuators to 25db?", "answer": "Answer\nTo attenuate a line level output to match a mic level input, use the A15LA; it is a 50 dB pad. Assuming you are recording a stereo signal, you will require two A15LA pads, one for the left output and one for the right output.\n\nPlacing two A15AS in series will provide nearly 50 dB of attenuation, but the actual attenuation amount depends upon the output impedance of the mixing board, and the input impedance of your camera.\n\nAlso, check out products by Beachtek.

Whereas, the Sennheiser UHF transmitters transmit at 50 mW on the same frequency spectrum. Could you please tell me why your highest quality mic system has such a low power output?", "answer": "Answer\nLonger battery life than transmitters with higher outputs.\nAllows more simultaneous operating systems due to less IM problems.\nCan be sold in Japan which regulates wireless mics to a max 10mW output.\nAllows Shure UHF to meet German specifications for spurious RF emissions.\nIn UHF bands, there is much less RF interference and the interference that is there has much lower power. Therefore, 10 mW is typically plenty of power.\nWhen tested against higher output competitors, we equal or exceed their transmission range - due to our very efficient antenna design and very efficient receiver design.\n\nAlso, realize that the specification that we must state according to FCC regulation, is the conductive output power. Conductive output power does not take into effect antenna efficiency.\n\nThe UC system uses 50 mW transmitters, because the antenna efficiency is not as good as the UHF series.\n\nWe suggest that you test the units yourself to see which one has a better range."}, {"question": "I have a Shure wireless microphone.

What was unique about it?", "answer": "Answer\nThe Battle Announce microphone was resistant to an explosive blast and the shock wave from the blast.   The mic had to be physically rugged to withstand the vibration of the blast, but also had to operate properly after the blast. \n\nThe mic element was controlled reluctance, also called controlled magnetic.  The mic diaphragm connects to a solid metal pin. The pin moves a ferrous armature that disturbs a magnetic field.  The fluxuating magnetic field produces a signal voltage in a stationary coil of wire. \n\nTo make such a mic element blast-resistant, a small spring is inserted between the solid metal pin and the armature.  During normal operation, the spring is stiff enough to maintain constant contact between the pin and the armature.  When a blast occurs, the spring is compressed and absorbs the shock wave, thus avoiding damage to the armature.  \n\nCheck out the 1942 Army Navy Acoustic Products pamphlet at: Vintage Shure Catalogs (1933 and later)\n\n   "}, {"question": "An old friend of the family recently passed away, and among the things he owned were two Shure \"bullet\"-type mics.

Although the mic provides stellar sound I have found that the frequency range of the Beta 58 I have seems to be wider, offering me a \"fuller, richer\" sound. I removed the face plate on the 55 and the lid to the 58. The capsules look the same. I was wondering, is the capsule in the 55 a \"straight\" 58? And if so, could the capsule in the 55 be replaced with a Beta 58 capsule to attain the same punch? It's just a thought.

The Super 55 uses a modified version of the Beta 58A cartridge. \n\nIf you already own a model 55SH Series II, consider the R115S upgrade kit; a do-it-yourself project. The output level of Super 55 is about 5 dB greater than the 55SH Series II, and the mic on/off switch still operates after the R115S is installed. R115S Instruction Sheet.\n\nNote that the Super 55 is designed to be mounted on a mic stand and is not meant to be a hand-held microphone.  If it is used as a hand-held mic and the singer's hand is wrapped around the rear of the microphone, the frequency response between 500 Hz and 1,000 Hz will be adversely affected.   If the mic must be held in the singer's hand, we strongly recommend using the stem of the microphone as the grasping point.\n\nAlso note that the Super 55, like the 55SH Series II, does not offer the same amount of \"P-popping\" protection as a mic with a ball grille, such as the SM58.

This low impedance signal is then sent to the PA mixer and/or recording mixer.\n\nThe unbalanced, high impedance device typically uses 1/4\" phone plug connectors. The output to the mixer is typically XLR connector. A direct box will also have a loop through for the unbalanced, high impedance signal. A direct box can be passive (does not require any power source) or active (requires a power source). Also, a direct box will provide some isolation between the instrument and the mixer.\n\nA direct box is most often used for guitars or keyboards. By placing a direct box between the guitar output and the guitar amplifier, the guitar signal can be sent to both the guitar amp and the mixer, while also providing isolation between the guitar amp and the mixer.\n\nTo summarize, a direct box will balance, isolate, and convert an unbalanced, high impedance signal to a balanced, low impedance signal."}, {"question": "Does Shure offer an educational booklet about recommended methods for remote antenna installation, antenna placement, and RF signal distribution?

Approximately 10 people around a table, in a variety of rooms. My previous recordings have picked up too much room noise, and the voices were difficult to hear. Any suggestions?", "answer": "Answer\nThe response to your question is rather complicated. On a basic level, the closer the mic is to the sound source (the talker) the better the audio will be as it will pick up more desirable sound. Uni-directional microphones would help to pick up less background noise, but in an \"around the table\" situation, using uni-directional microphones means that you must use more than just one microphone. More microphones pick up more noise and reverberation than just one. If you use more than two or three microphones, use an automatic mixer as it turns mics on and off as people speak.\n\nBelow links are to Shure applications bulletins that address this in depth. The easiest thing is to find a really quiet room and use just one omni-directional microphone in the center of the table. Our MX391BP/0 would be an appropriate table mic.

But what exactly is Multicast and IGMP, and how does it work? This FAQ is intended to give an overview of Multicast and IGMP, and how proper switch configuration can create very stable audio network. Please note that this article will not discuss IPv6 Multicast, which is not currently supported by Shure devices.\n\nWhat is multicast traffic?\n\nMulticast traffic is a type of IP network traffic intended for one or more destinations. Multicast is more efficient than unicast traffic because a source only needs to send data to the network once, letting the network do the hard part. It's also less bandwidth-intensive than broadcast traffic, because only the units who want the traffic will see it. Receiving devices can be on the local network or across the Internet. For Dante and AES67 networks, we are only concerned with multicast traffic which remains within the local network.\n\nMulticast uses special IPv4 destination addresses between 224.0.0.0 and 239.255.255.255. Each address is generally referred to as a Multicast Group. Traffic intended for the multicast group has a destination address of that multicast group and a source address of the device that sent it. There are a few special groups of addresses:\n224.0.0.0-224.0.0.255: These are reserved for the local network which the devices are on. It won't be passed along to another subnet by a router. This range is sometimes designated as 224.0.0.0/24, and most switches will send this traffic to all devices on the local network--with a few exceptions noted later.\n239.0.0.0-239.255.255.255: These are reserved for use by private organizations, and won't be routed over the Internet. Organizations are free to use these addresses as they see fit.\nAll multicast traffic is UDP/IP, and various manufacturers and organizations have standardized a wide variety of multicast protocols. The special IPv4 multicast group addresses are mapped to a special range of MAC addresses, between 01-00-5E-00-00-00 to 01-00-5E-7F-FF-FF. Note that there is not a 1:1 match between multicast group addresses--because there are 28 bits of freedom in IPv4 multicast addresses but only 23 bits of freedom in IPv4 multicast MAC addresses, each IPv4 MAC address can represent up to 32 possible IPv4 multicast groups.\n\nIndividual devices will decide which multicast groups they are interested in joining. In small networks, this works like broadcast traffic--all units receive all traffic, and they self-select the data they want. In larger networks, though, a more efficient solution is needed. This is provided by Internet Group Management Protocol, or IGMP.\n\nWhat is IGMP and IGMP Snooping?\n\nIGMP is a protocol used by network equipment to specify which devices should receive which multicast groups. Without IGMP, a network switch would forward any multicast traffic to all switchports on the switch. Devices would be responsible for filtering out the traffic that they do not want to receive. This would not work well in large network, as undesired traffic would overwhelm devices.\n\nWhen IGMP is configured and in use, one device on the network is designated as the IGMP Querier, and it is responsible for asking devices what multicast groups they want to join on the network. The querier then tracks those responses and passes them to the switch or switches to add to their Multicast Forwarding Database. This database is a table of multicast IPv4 or multicast MAC addresses as well the switchports which should receive that traffic. When multicast traffic arrives at the switch, the switch checks the table and then passes the traffic to all ports which should receive it. \n\nBecause the Querier communicates with devices on the network, it needs to have an IP address in the same subnet as the devices wishing to receive the multicast traffic. The Querier is often running on your network switch, so the network switch must have an IP address on the local network (as opposed to the factory default address, in some cases).\n\nThe Querier has a few user-configurable options. The most important is the Querier Interval, which is the rate at which the querier will ask devices to report back what groups they wish to maintain membership in. We recommend setting this as low as it can go--30 seconds is a safe number generally. The network switch or switches will talk to the Querier to determine which devices want which Multicast groups. The switches then apply filtering to incoming network traffic, sending multicast traffic only to the desired destinations. When there are multiple switches configured, all switches talk to the Querier to gather this information. The port on a switch which can see the querier is often called the mrouter port.\n\nThere are two versions of IGMP commonly in use: IGMPv2 and IGMPv3. IGMPv2 deals only with the destination multicast group. In IGMPv2, a device registers its interest in receiving all traffic sent to a given multicast group, and the network hardware obliges by sending all traffic sent to that group, regardless of origin. IGMPv3 adds the concept of Source-Specific Multicast (SSM), which allows a device to specify not only the group it wishes to receive traffic from, but also the desired sender(s). In addition, while IGMPv2 join requests are sent to the multicast group address desired, IGMPv3 adds IGMP-specific multicast groups to handle join and leave requests. AES67 and Dante both use IGMPv2, though an IGMPv3 querier can handle IGMPv2 requests. Shure devices only require IGMPv2.\n\nMisconfigured IGMP settings are the primary cause of Network Audio problems. Please review our Configuring a Network Switch for Shure Devices and Dante/AES67 FAQ.\n\nRegistered and Unregistered Multicast\n\nIn most cases, devices will register for the multicast groups that they want to receive by responding to the IGMP Querier's requests. Each requested group is then added to each switch's Multicast Forwarding Database along with the ports which should receive the traffic. However, sometimes multicast traffic exists on the network which is not registered at all.\n\nCertain IPv4 multicast groups receive special treatment. 224.0.0.0/24 (224.0.0.0-224.0.0.255) is one of these groups, and the IGMP standard generally requires that this traffic be broadcast to all ports on the same VLAN or switch.\n\nHowever, in some cases a multicast source will be sending traffic to a normal multicast group which has no registered receivers. This can happen when a device, like a video encoder, does not want to receive its own traffic back, and no devices have asked to receive the signal. Switches usually have a configuration option to either forward this traffic to all switchports or filter it. In audio-only networks, forwarding is generally advised, as this traffic is usually low bandwidth. However, filtering the traffic can cause problems, such as preventing devices from discovering one another. However, filtering is required for any networks which contain video traffic due to the amount of bandwidth video requires.\n\nMost switches have the ability to create custom forwarding rules for specific multicast groups. In general, this is usually not necessary. However, in cases where filtering of unregistered multicast traffic is required (for example, in networks with multicast video sources), you may need to manually forward specific groups. If this situation applies to you, please review the Shure Multicast Groups and Ports document for more information on required multicast groups.\n\nAn Example of IGMP Snooping in Action\n\nA technician is installing two new conference rooms at his company, and will be using two MXA910's and a third-party DSP unit in each room. To simplify installation and management of the systems, the technician has chosen to use a ten-port Cisco SG350-10P network switch, which will be shared between both rooms. The switch and DSP units are located in his IT closet, and the MXA910 mics are connected directly back to the same switch from the rooms using Cat6 cable. The MXA910's will send audio to the DSP units via AES67, which uses Multicast audio streams.\n\nThe network has IP Addresses assigned as follows:\nRoom\nDevice\nInternal Function\nAddress\nSubnet Mask\nSwitch Port\nRoom A\nFront MXA910\nShure Control\n10.1.1.10\n255.255.255.0\nGigabit 01\nRoom A\n  Network Audio\n10.1.1.20\n255.255.255.0\nGigabit 01\nRoom A\nRear MXA910\nShure Control\n10.1.1.11\n255.255.255.0\nGigabit 02\nRoom A\n  Network Audio\n10.1.1.21\n255.255.255.0\nGigabit 02\nRoom B\nFront MXA910\nShure Control\n10.1.1.30\n255.255.255.0\nGigabit 03\nRoom B\n  Network Audio\n10.1.1.40\n255.255.255.0\nGigabit 03\nRoom B\nRear MXA910\nShure Control\n10.1.1.31\n255.255.255.0\nGigabit 04\nRoom B\n  Network Audio\n10.1.1.41\n255.255.255.0\nGigabit 04\nIT Closet\nDSP A\nNetwork Audio\n10.1.1.22\n255.255.255.0\nGigabit 05\nIT Closet\nDSP B\nNetwork Audio\n10.1.1.42\n255.255.255.0\nGigabit 06\nIT Closet\nCisco SG350-10P\nManagement IP\n10.1.1.254\n255.255.255.0\nInternal\nIT Closet\nEngineer PC\nComputer IP\n10.1.1.250\n255.255.255.0\nGigabit 07\nThe following Multicast groups were assigned by the Dante chipset in the MXA910 mics (note that in practice, the addresses are randomized):\nRoom A\nFront MXA910\n239.69.20.20\nRoom A\nRear MXA910\n239.69.21.21\nRoom B\nFront MXA910\n239.69.40.40\nRoom B\nRear MXA910\n239.69.41.41\nIn addition, the MXA910 mics will need access to the following IP Multicast Groups to function:\n224.0.0.230-224.0.0.233: Dante Discovery and Metering\n224.0.0.251: mDNS for Device Discovery (also known as Bonjour)\n224.0.1.129: PTP Clocking--both PTPv1 for Dante and PTPv2 for AES67\n239.255.254.253: Shure Control, for Software Update Utility\n239.255.255.255: Session Announcement Protocol, to announce AES67 streams\nWhen each device boots up, they send a Join request to the group addresses they wish to join:\n224.0.1.129: All MXA910's and DSP Units\n239.69.20.20: Room A Front MXA910 and DSP A\n239.69.21.21: Room A Rear MXA910 and DSP A\n239.69.40.40: Room B Front MXA910 and DSP B\n239.69.41.41: Room B Rear MXA910 and DSP B\n239.255.254.253: All MXA910's\n239.255.255.255: All MXA910s and DSP Units\nThe IGMP Querier, running on the SG350, detects these join requests and adds the device switchports to the forwarding table along with the desired group. Now each device will receive Multicast traffic for the groups it has joined. Note that the devices do not ask to join 224.0.0.230-224.0.0.233 or 224.0.0.251, because those groups are assumed to be flooded to the local subnet. If the switch is configured to Filter Unregistered Multicast Traffic, then those two groups will not be sent to all devices, and they will not be able to see each other via mDNS, nor will the Engineer PC be able to query the Dante chipsets for information. You would need to manually add these groups to the Multicast Forwarding Database and elect which ports should receive them.\n\nOnce all devices have joined their desired Multicast groups, they will not be flooded with undesired traffic, some of which may be measured in tens of megabits per second."}, {"question": "I have been told that you cannot use stage monitors with the KSM microphones because of its sensitivity.

It is a distortion measurement that gives a reading for several signals, each representing a certain vertical recording angle. Our equipment to do this is no longer available.\n\nThe minimum distortion on one of these bands indicates the vertical tracking angle of the cartridge. Most of our cartridges are between 20 and 25 degrees, every sample being slightly different. You can't tell by looking at the cartridge.\n\n2) The dynamic stabilizer reduces the actual stylus pressure by 1/2 gram. Set antiskate to equal the actual stylus pressure.\n\nAs an example, if you want 1 gram of actual stylus pressure and you want to use the dynamic stabilizer, set the tonearm tracking weight to 1.5 grams. The anti-skate should be set to equal the actual stylus pressure, i.e., 1 gram.\n\nIf you intend to use the dynamic stabilizer AND you want 1 gram of pressure on the stylus, set the tonearm tracking weight to 1.5 grams; set the antiskate to 1 gram."}, {"question": "I am selling Shure product that will be sent to another country.

To get good reception, I need to remote the antennas into the same room that the transmitter is in. How do I properly do that?", "answer": "Answer\nAntennas are measured in terms of the wavelength of the signal that they are designed to pick up. The standard antenna supplied with Shure VHF wireless systems is a \"1/4-wave\", meaning that it is 1/4 of the length of the radio wave being received.\n\nFor good performance, the following guidelines should be observed when remote mounting antennas:\nUse 1/2-wave antennas or 1/4-wave antennas with a ground plane. Do NOT remote-mount the standard 1/4-wave antennas supplied with the wireless system. When this antenna is removed from the receiver chassis, its impedance changes dramatically. This causes a significant loss of signal strength, because part of the signal is reflected back into the antenna by the cable. A 1/2-wave antenna\u2019s performance stays the same regardless of how it is mounted.\nPlace antennas properly. Antennas should be mounted away from large metal objects or surfaces, which cause reflections that can reduce signal strength. Antennas should also be kept away from sources of RF energy, such as computers, digital devices, AC power equipment, etc. For best diversity performance, antennas should by placed from 1/2-wavelength to 1 full wavelength apart (3 to 6 feet for VHF). Wider separation between antennas does not offer significant benefit. For diversity wireless systems, both antennas must be located in the performance area, and connected to the receiver via separate coaxial cables.\nUse the appropriate antenna cable. For proper performance, the impedance of the cable MUST match the impedance of the antenna input on the receiver (50 ohms). An impedance mismatch causes some of the signal to be reflected back into the cable, resulting in a loss of signal level. Do NOT use common RG-59 cable, which is designed for television signals and has an impedance of 75 ohms. Different types of cable exhibit different amounts of signal loss over a specified length. More than 3 dB of loss should be considered unacceptable. It is not necessary for both antennas on a diversity receiver to be connected to identical lengths of cable; ideally, each antenna should be connected to the minimum length of cable necessary to reach the remote mounting position.\nFor very long cable runs, an RF amplifier, such as the UA834V can be used at the antenna to boost signal level, but it also amplifies the background RF noise in addition to the transmitter\u2019s signal. In such cases it may be better to locate the entire receiver closer to the performance area, and run a long audio cable to the mixing console. A long audio cable (balanced and line level) is less likely to pick up interference than a long antenna cable.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Cable Length from Antenna to Receiver Appropriate Cable Type Signal Loss per 100 ft.\nUp to 50 feet RG-58C/U (Belden 8262 or similar) 7.5 dB per 100 ft.\n50 to 100 feet RG-213/U (Belden 8267 or similar) 2.7 dB per 100 ft.\nOver 100 feet RG-8/U (Belden 7810A, 9913 or similar) 1.8 dB per 100 ft.\n "}, {"question": "Do you make a wireless mic that can withstand some water.

Erik West, a Milwaukee-based freelance broadcast audio engineer, has made the perfection of that distinctive sound his audio calling card. Working for Fox Sports both regionally in Milwaukee and for national games there, in Chicago. and elsewhere, West has found that replacing his older shotgun mics with the Shure VP89L has taken his signature sound to a new and higher level.\n\n\"I came to the world of broadcast audio engineering from my background in mixing live music,\" says West. \"I EQ my batcracks a lot like a kick drum. I boost a little high-end snap, pull out some of the mids, and then boost some thumb on the bottom. With the VP89L, I get much more control over that than I had before. I've always been proud of my bat-crack sound, but these mics really took it over the top.\"\n\nWest points to two specific qualities of the VP89L that combine to make his results better than any previous shotgun mic. \"Most shotguns are about high frequency off-axis rejection, but the first thing I noticed with the VP89L was how well it rejected low frequencies as well,\" he explains. \"The 'thump' in a bat-crack is at a higher frequency than in a kick drum - right where you would hear it in the murmur of the crowd. With the VP89L, I can still boost that the way I like, but not suffer the consequence of coloring the crowd noise. It also has very crisp highs, which I don't have to boost as much as I did before.\"\n\nThe action around home plate, along with the sounds of the crowd, are key elements in achieving the goal of making home baseball viewers feel like they are in the ballpark. While exact mic positions vary with the layout of any given stadium, West's typical procedure is to position his two home plate shotguns on either side of (and behind) the backstop netting, roughly 15 feet above field level and aimed about knee-high at home plate, roughly 35 feet away.\n\n\"That positioning gives me a nice, wide sweet spot,\" says West. \"You can hear the glove-pop, the umpire, and of course, the crack of the bat. You can really hear the difference between a solid hit and a broken bat, which is great for the home viewer and the announcers.\"\n\nTo augment the on-field sounds with crowd noise, West relies on another Shure field production microphone, the VP88, a mid-side stereo mic that he feels is perfect for that task. \"One thing I don't like with crowd noise is the typical technique of aiming a couple shotguns out from the broadcast booth,\" he notes. \"It's just not a good sound. For my regular gig doing Milwaukee Brewers games at Miller Park, what I do is position the VP88 directly behind the plate, directly under the robo-camera there, about 20 feet from voices, aimed into the crowd. I use the Wide setting, which gives me clear sound of things like a vendor on the left yelling 'beer here' or 'get your peanuts' coming from the right, but without picking up many individual voices from the fans, and it handles the dynamics easily when things go from fairly quiet to really loud. It's a mic position that I highly recommend, and the perfect mic for the job.\"\n\nFor Erik West, the key to success is providing a sonic experience that makes viewers feel they are at the ballpark, and he knows that the VP Series mics from Shure have played a major role in improving his ability to do that. \"The VP89L long shotgun has a fatness to the low end that is really the difference between sounding okay and great on my bat-cracks,\" he concludes. \"They're also built and tested to the same standards as Shure's rock and roll mics, which I really appreciate. I tried going back to standard truck mics, but they just don't measure up. Being able to have that low-end glove pop and that woody bat sound - that's what I love about these Shure shotgun mics. It's now my signature sound.\""}, {"question": "What is the wiring of the mini 3-pin xlr of the Beta 98 microphone. Which pin provides the 5V Bias Voltage and which pin is ground?

What does each do?", "answer": "Answer\nAll Shure A15 devices have XLR connectors.\n\nA15AS - Attenuator Switchable.  The A15AS reduces the signal level from a microphone by 15 dB, or 20 dB, or 25 dB depending on the switch position.  Here is a typical use.  A microphone with a \"hot\" output level (MX418D) overloads the input of a mixer and causes distortion.  Insert the A15AS just before the mixer input to reduce the microphone signal level.  The A15AS does pass phantom power so it may be used with a condenser mic as well as a dynamic mic.\n\nA15BT - Bridging Transformer.  The A15BT is used to connect devices of different impedances and/or different signal levels.  The A15BT can also convert an unbalanced signal into a balanced signal, and vice versa.  The precise function of the A15BT depends upon which XLR end is used as the input.   Here is a typical use.  An unbalanced output from a consumer CD player must connect to a balanced mic input on a mixer.  Using an adapter cable, connect the CD player output to the A15BT female XLR; then connect the A15BT male XLR to a mic cable that terminates at the mixer.  Unlike the A15AS, the A15BT DOES NOT pass phantom power.\n\nA15HP - High Pass. The A15HP passes higher frequencies and attenuates (reduces) lower frequencies.   Here is a typical use.  A microphone is used outdoors in a high wind; the wind produces excessive low frequency noise in the mic signal.  Insert the A15HP just before the mixer to reduce the undesirable low frequency noise.  The A15HP does pass phantom power.\n\nA15LA - Line Attenuator.  The A15LA reduces the signal level by 50 dB.  Here is a typical use.  A mixer's line level output must connect to the mic level input of another mixer.  Insert the A15LA just before the mixer input to reduce the line level signal to a mic level signal.  The A15LA does pass phantom power.\n\nA15PRS - Polarity Reverser Switchable.  The A15PRS connects pin 2 of the female XLR to pin 3 of the male XLR, and connects pin 3 of the female XLR to pin 2 of the male XLR.  This polarity reversal can be undone by the switch.  Here is typical use.  Two microphones are on a lectern; one has an incorrectly wired cable causing it to have opposite polarity.  When the two mic signals are combined in the mixer, the resulting audio is hollow and thin.  Insert the A15PRS just before the mixer and reverse the polarity for one of the mics. The A15PRS does pass phantom power.\n\nA15RF - Radio Filter.  The A15RF reduces audible interference caused by AM radio, FM radio, and other types of radio frequency interference.  Here is typical use.  A choir mic in a church has audible interference caused by a nearby AM radio station transmitter.  Insert the A15RF at the output of the microphone, or at the input of the mixer.  Severe interference situations may require two A15RF units - one at the mic output and one at the mixer input.  The A15RF does pass phantom power.\n\nA15TG - Tone Generator.  The A15TG provides a continuous mic level signal of 400 Hz.  Operation requires a 1.5 V button battery.  Here is a typical use.

If the instructions here conflict with those provided by your cartridge or tonearm manufacturer (assuming you're fortunate enough to get any), follow those from the manufacturer. Furthermore, Audiophilia will not be held responsible for any damage sustained by your cartridge, tonearm, turntable or anyone foolish enough to sneak up on you from behind while following these instructions.]\n\nWith the near-complete erosion of support for vinyl playback at the retail level, audiophiles devoted to the analog disc have little recourse but to become adept at the finer points of cartridge setup. And while correctly setting up these delicate devices does require relatively vast amounts of both time and patience, the steps involved are well within the scope of the audio enthusiast with a steady hand and the right tools at his disposal.\n\nThe goal of vinyl playback is to extract, as faithfully as possible, the tiny signal carved into the surface of the record by the record cutting lathe. If the stylus replicates exactly (in three dimensions) the cutter's path through the record groove, then the signal extracted should be an exact replica of the one deposited in the groove by the cutter. Of course there are many reasons why correct stylus geometry with respect to the groove is insufficient to guarantee perfect analog signal extraction, the electromagnetic properties of the cartridge's internal wiring and magnet structure, and the shape of the stylus itself being but two. Even exercising the utmost care and patience during setup, the best we can hope for is a good approximation of the original signal, which, in practice, turns out to be more than sufficient for superb musical results.\n\nTools at a Glance\n\nHere's a quick summary of the tools you'll likely need to install your phono cartridge:\nPair of tweezers\nSmall needlenose pliers\nToothpicks\nNon-magnetic headshell screws, washers and, possibly, nuts if not provided by the cartridge manufacturer\nSmall, non-magnetic, screwdriver set\nStylus pressure gauge, like the Shure SFG-2\nA lighted magnifying glass of at least 10X power\nAn alignment gauge such as the DB Systems DBP-10 (or the one provided by your tonearm manufacturer)\nA test record such as Hi Fi News and Record Review's HFN-1\n1. Installation\n\nFirstly, if your cartridge was supplied with a cover that clips over the stylus/cantilever assembly, keep it in place throughout this step and the wiring step described below - it might just prevent you from shearing off the cantilever on your $2000 cartridge during an untimely lapse in concentration!\n\nCartridge installation begins by affixing the cartridge body to the tonearm headshell. Tonearm headshells typically contain either slots or holes through which screws (usually supplied with the cartridge, and should be of the non-magnetic variety) may be passed into the cartridge body. Slotted headshells allow for the position of the cartridge to be adjusted for correct alignment. Headshells containing fixed-position holes (such as those of the venerable Rega RB300 and Naim Aro) assume that the geometry of the partnering cartridge is such that correct alignment will be achieved using the holes supplied. Unfortunately, tonearms whose headshells contain fixed holes will not allow for correct alignment of all cartridges . They do, however, make setup of compatible cartridges relatively simple (tonearm manufacturers who advocate fixed-hole headshells usually have a particular cartridge, or set of cartridges, in mind at the time of design - namely their own or those of a manufacturer whose products are believed to work well with the arm in question).\n\nThe holes in a cartridge body, meant to accept the screws which affix the cartridge to the headshell, generally come in two flavors: threaded (or tapped), and non-threaded. Threaded holes are more convenient to use, as they they obviate the need for the small, difficult-to-handle nuts required to secure the cartridge screws to a non-threaded cartridge body. If your cartridge does not have a threaded body, then you'll have to resort to using nuts to secure the cartridge screws. If possible, insert the screws from the bottom of the cartridge, through the slots or holes in the headshell, so that the nuts can be secured from above. Those lucky enough to have a tapped cartridge can simply insert the screws down through the headshell into the tapped holes in the cartridge body (it is a good idea to use a washer between each screw head and the headshell so that the tightened screw will not mar the headshell's finish). In either case, the cartridge screws should be tightened slightly so that the cartridge is somewhat secure but still allowed to move with moderate hand pressure. In the case of a fixed-hole headshell, the cartridge screws can be fully tightened as no further adjustment is possible. Keep in mind that cartridge screws should be quite snug but not over-tightened. Overtightening can distort the cartridge body or, in the worst case, cause it to crack.\n\n2. Wiring\n\nOnce the cartridge is affixed to the headshell, connect the fine color-coded tonearm wires to the corresponding color-coded pins on the back of the cartridge body. While connecting the tonearm wires to the cartridge pins, always handle the wires with great care - they are fragile and can be damaged by surprisingly little force. Grab the small metal cartridge clips which terminate the tonearm wires using a pair of tweezers (never grab the tonearm wires themselves!), and guide the clips onto the cartridge pins. In some cases, the clips may be difficult to fit over the cartridge pins unless they are pried open slightly using a small screwdriver or a toothpick. Don't overdo it or the clips won't make good contact with the pins. In the event that the clips are spread too wide, they can be squeezed back together using a small pair of needlenose pliers..\n\n3. Tracking Weight\n\n(Note that if a stylus guard is still in place at this point, remove it now and leave it off through the remainder of the setup process.)\n\nTo play back a vinyl disc, the stylus must make good contact with the walls of the record groove. The question is, how much downward force should be applied so that the stylus will neither lose contact with the groove wall as it traces the path of the groove, nor fail to faithfully follow the path of the groove due to excessive downforce? Cartridge manufacturer's typically specify the downforce, or tracking weight, for a particular cartridge, usually as a range of recommended values in grams. It is best to begin the process of determining the optimal tracking weight within the specified range by setting it to the highest value within that range. To dispel a common myth, a cartridge given insufficient tracking weight is more likely to cause damage to the groove wall than one whose tracking weight is set at the high end of the recommended range. This is because a cartridge that is tracking too lightly will tend to lose contact with the groove wall, or mistrack, on highly modulated passages, causing damage to the groove as it bounces about in an attempt to regain contact.\n\nThere are several devices available currently which can be used to measure tracking weight. The Shure SFG-2 stylus pressure gauge is the most popular due to its low price and reasonable accuracy. The Shure gauge works essentially like a balance: the stylus is placed in a recessed groove at one end of the balance, and a sliding counterweight, towards the opposite end of the balance, is moved along a calibrated scale in an effort to counteract the weight of the cartridge. When perfect balance is achieved, the weight of the stylus against the balance can be read directly from the calibrated scale. Although the results achieved with the Shure gauge are approximate at best (results are dependent on the accuracy of the calibrated scale, as well as the user's ability to visually judge the degree of balance achieved), they are more than good enough in most cases.\n\nShure states that the SFG-2 is accurate to 1/10 of a gram for tracking weights less than 1.5 grams. For cartridge's that track at heavier weights, it is, in my experience, more realistic to expect measurements taken with the SFG-2 to be accurate to within 2/10 of a gram. Still, given the fact that tracking weight can vary by as much as a few tenths of a gram as a cartridge tracks record warps, the Shure gauge should prove sufficiently accurate for most installations.\n\nFor those who desire the ultimate in accuracy and convenience, the Winds ALM-01 Arm Load Meter, accurate to 1/100 of a gram, is a must-have. At about $800, however, this item is only for those vinylphiles with the deepest of pockets (a less expensive alternative is the ALM-1, accurate to within 1/10 of a gram, priced at about $500). A competing device, soon to be released by cartridge manufacturer Clearaudio, is to retail for approximately $375, although its accuracy is unknown at the time of writing.\n\nThe Winds gauge is surely the simplest and most accurate gauge I've ever had the pleasure of using. It is completely electronic in nature and is, therefore, not prone to the errors inherent in balance-style devices such as the SFG-2. Use of the gauge is trivial: the user must first zero its LCD display using the built-in calibration wheel. The stylus is then lowered onto a circular sensor located on the top surface of the gauge. After a few seconds, during which time the LCD display gradually converges on a numeric value, the tracking weight can be read from the display.\n\nThe only gripe I have with the Winds gauge is that I found it to produce wildly incorrect results, with no warning, if its 9 Volt battery is not fully charged. Considering its price, the omission of a low battery indicator is inexcusable, especially in view of the consequences of setting a cartridge's tracking force terribly wrong (that is, after all, why one would want to use a gauge like the Winds in the first place!).\n\nBefore attempting to set the cartridge's tracking weight using a gauge and/or a test record, it is best to zero-balance, or \"float\", the arm with the cartridge affixed. This provides a good reference point from which to begin to increase the tracking weight towards the desired value. The arm/cartridge is floated by moving the arm's counterweight either towards or away from the headshell until the arm reaches a point at which it floats with virtual weightlessness. At this point, the tracking weight of the cartridge is approximately 0 grams and can be set accurately using a gauge like one of those described above.\n\n4. Arm Height: Part One\n\nWith the stylus pressure set to the high end of the manufacturer's specified range, it's a good time to adjust the height of the tonearm so that the arm tube is roughly parallel to the platter. You'll fine tune the height of the arm later in the setup process, but getting it set parallel now will make later adjustments that much easier. Most arms allow for some form of height adjustment. Inexpensive arms, like the Audioquest PT series, typically provide a set screw which holds the arm pillar in place, which allows for a wide range of adjustment but makes it difficult to repeatedly find previous settings. More expensive arms, like the Graham 2.0 and the VPI JMW, provide more sophisticated height adjustment mechanisms which contain finely calibrated scales and allow previous settings to be repeated with great ease. The Rega RB300 is one of the few arms in its class that provides no height adjustment mechanism. However, small spacers can be placed under the arm to raise it to the desired height.\n\nDon't fuss too much over the height of the arm at this point. You'll have plenty of time to obsess over it with typical analog retentiveness later in the process.\n\n5. Alignment\n\nRecords are cut using a cutter head that is positioned at a tangent, or parallel, to the cut groove. With a pivoted tonearm, which forces the stylus to trace an arc across the record surface, only an approximation to the cutter head's tangential path is possible. The seminal work of Baerwald ca. 1941 showed that the tracking error of a pivoted stylus could be minimized if the stylus is aligned such that it is parallel to the groove at two points along its curved path: specifically, at the two points that are a distance of 66 and 120.9 mm (or 2.6 and 4.76 inches) from the center of the spindle (note that these numbers assume that the inner and outer radii of the record's grooves are no smaller than 2.375\" and no larger than 5.75\" respectively, which is, thankfully, the case for most records). These two points are commonly referred to as \"null points\" as a tracking error of zero is achieved when the stylus is tangent to the groove at these points. A commercially available cartridge alignment gauge can be used to align the cartridge such that it satisfies the tangency requirements at the null points.\n\nMost modern cartridge alignment gauges, such as the popular D B Systems DBP-10, are designed to produce correct Baerwald two-point alignment, although there are some that are designed using a less common one-point method (the alignment jig that is included with the VPI JMW tonearm, for example). When aligning a cartridge for tangency using any alignment protractor, it is essential to remember that you are attempting to align the cantilever (and, hence, the stylus), not the cartridge body. There is no guarantee that the cantilever is perfectly aligned within the cartridge body, so simply aligning the cartridge body will not necessarily produce the desired result. Furthermore, many cartridge bodies have non-parallel sides, making tangential alignment of the cartridge body with the lines of tangency on the gauge virtually impossible.\n\nMost alignment gauges are simply cardboard, plastic (or, in some cases, glass) templates onto which are printed or scribed the null point(s) and lines of tangency against which the cartridge should be aligned. The template is placed over the turntable's spindle (made possible via a spindle-sized hole drilled in the template) and placed against the platter. The cartridge's position in the headshell is then manipulated until the stylus is parallel to the gauge's lines of tangency at the null point(s). This process is made somewhat easier by the use of a small, lighted magnifying glass which will allow you to better view the near-microscopic stylus and scrawny cantilever, both usually obscured by the shadow of the cartridge body. This is, by far, the most frustrating and time-consuming part of the cartridge installation process. Making small adjustments to align the stylus with the null point(s) invariably alters its relationship to the lines of tangency - or vice versa. Keep the screws holding the cartridge to the headshell as tight as possible, but just loose enough to allow slight changes in cartridge position. With any luck, the force of the screws against the headshell will hold the cartridge in position while you check your changes against the template (if you're unlucky, the force of the tonearm wires against the back of the cartridge will negate all of your hard work up to that point!). When everything is lined up, tighten the headshell screws with one hand while holding the cartridge steady with the other. Hold the cartridge firmly in place, as the torsional force generated while snugging down the screws will tend to twist the cartridge in the headshell, thus spoiling the cartridge's tangency.\n\nWhile it might, at some point into this process, seem that aligning what has now become known as \"that freaking cartridge\" with \"those freaking lines and points\" of \"that freaking gauge\" is virtually impossible, take solace in the fact that you're only a dozen or so hours away from playing a freaking record.\n\n6. Azimuth\n\nWith the cartridge aligned (and the sweat squeegeed from your turntable's platter), it's time to set the cantilever's azimuth, or perpendicularity to the groove. Without a correct azimuth setting, the electrical output from the cartridge's two generators will be unequal (when reproducing a signal with equal amplitude in both channels), resulting in a channel imbalance and a shift of the soundstage to either the left or right. Be warned, however, that not all tonearms allow for changes in azimuth, the Rega RB300 being one prominent example. Other tonearms, such as the Audioquest PT family, allow for crude azimuth adjustment via a set screw at the base of the headshell. More costly tonearms, such as the unipivots from Graham and VPI, supply sophisticated azimuth adjustments, via one or more weights, that make setting and maintaining correct azimuth a relative joy.\n\nAzimuth can be roughed-in visually by inspecting the front of the cartridge while the stylus is in the record groove. Does one side of the cartridge appear to be closer to the record surface than the other? If so, then use whatever means the tonearm manufacturer provided to adjust the azimuth such that the cartridge body is parallel (within the limits of your vision) to the record surface. Once a rough azimuth adjustment is found visually, it can be fine tuned via measurement.\n\nThe optimal azimuth setting is the one that produces electrical signals of equal amplitude from the cartridge's generators when signals of equal amplitude are present in both channels of the record. Therefore, if we play a record with the same signal in both channels (a monophonic record, for example), but wire one channel out of phase, then the correct azimuth adjustment is the one that produces zero (or near zero) output when the two out-of-phase channels are summed (remember that summing two signals, one out of phase with respect to the other, results in no signal due to destructive interference.)\n\nThis out-of-phase, or \"null\", test, can be performed in several ways. If you've got a test record such as the one produced by Hi Fi News and Record Review (and I recommend it highly), then you can simply make use of the azimuth test track it provides. This test track consists of a mono signal with the left and right channels out of phase. If your preamplifier has a mono blend switch (which sums the left and right channels), you can simply play the test track, engage the mono switch, and adjust the cartridge's azimuth until you hear minimal output through the loudspeakers.\n\nIn the absence of a test record with an out-of--phase mono track, you can simulate such a track by playing a mono record through a DIY phase-inverting cable. To build such a cable, buy yourself a cheap female-to-male patch cord from your local Radio Shack, cut one leg of the cable in half, and strip away some of the insulation around the copper conductors. Then, solder the positive conductor from one half of the cut leg of the cable to the negative conductor from the other half of the cut leg. Finally, solder the negative conductor from the first half of the cable to the positive conductor from the second half. Cover the exposed conductors/solder joints with electrical tape. You now have a cable that inverts phase in one channel. Now, connect the male end of your tonearm cable to the female end of the inverting cable you've just created, and connect the other end of the inverting cable to the inputs of your phono stage or the phono inputs of your preamplifier. Play a mono record (I use the DCC reissue of Sonny Rollins' Tenor Madness) and switch your preamplifier into mono mode. The azimuth of your cartridge can now be adjusted until you hear zero (or, at least, minimal) output from your loudspeakers.\n\nIf your preamplifier doesn't provide a mono blend switch (this feature is becoming rapidly extinct, and I applaud Audible Illusions for continuing to provide one on its Modulus 3A product), then you can dial-in the azimuth of your cartridge using either an oscilloscope (if you have access to one), cartridge analyzer (if you can find one), or the rough 'n ready visual test described above.\n\n7. Tracking Weight: Revisited\n\nWith the tracking force roughed in, alignment spot on, and azimuth nailed down, a test record, such as the terrific one produced by Hi Fi News and Record Review, can be used to really optimize the setup. In particular, the cartridge's ability to track difficult passages can be fine-tuned using several bands on the test disc. The tracking tests consist of a test tone (300 Hz in both channels at +15dB) spaced evenly across the surface of the record in order to gauge the consistency of the arm/cartridge's tracking ability. With the cartridge's tracking weight set to the manufacturer's specified maximum value, the tones produced should be pure, without any audible signs of buzzing or distortion. Be aware that buzzing in one channel only is likely the result of an incorrect anti-skating setting (discussed below), rather than a problem with the cartridge's tracking weight. If the signal is stable in one channel but unstable in another, don't increase the tracking weight in an attempt to compensate. You'll likely be able to eliminate the buzzing in the one channel when you set the anti-skate shortly.\n\nThe tracking weight can now be decreased gradually until it reaches the minimum value for which the tracking tests continue to produce good results. The resultant tracking weight should represent a good balance between tracking ability and record wear. Of course, modifying the tracking weight changes the deflection of the cantilever with respect to the cartridge body. In other words, the Herculean effort you expended to get the stylus to fall squarely on the magic null point(s) of the alignment gauge has just been undone by a simple change in tracking weight (you'll soon come to realize that almost every cartridge setup parameter is affected by every other). Fix the cartridge alignment, and recheck the tracking weight and azimuth while you're at it. If that old CD player in the corner is starting to look awfully good about now, don't despair, you're getting there!\n\n8. Anti-Skate\n\nThe last critical setup parameter that can be optimized using a test record, such as the one from Hi Fi News and Record Review, is anti-skate. The so-called skating force is a vector force which tends to draw the tonearm/cartridge towards the center of the record when the cartridge is mounted in an offset headshell i.e. a headshell that is at an angle to the line of the arm tube (most modern tonearms utilize offset headshells in an effort to minimize tracking distortion). Unless countered, this force can produce uneven, and premature, wear of the walls of the record groove and stylus, and compromises the ideal spatial relationship between the cartridge's coils and magnet structure. Unfortunately, the skating force varies continuously across the surface of the record and is, therefore, difficult to combat fully. Most tonearms contain a spring-like device that applies a force in the opposite direction of the skating force with approximately equal magnitude. Some arm designers, most notably VPI's Harry Weisfeld, eschew anti-skating devices, claiming that they are a source of vibration and don't accurately and consistently counteract the skating force over the whole of the record surface. Bob Graham , designer of the Graham 2.0 unipivot tonearm, disagrees. His tonearm incorporates a unique lever/weight system that produces a variable force that does, according to Graham, change in direct proportion to the skating forces involved.\n\nUsing the anti-skating mechanism provided on your tonearm, adjust the amount of anti-skate until the Bias Setting tracks on side 1 of the Hi Fi News and Record Review test record produce a clean, undistorted signal in both channels. Buzzing in the right channel indicates that more anti-skating force is required, whereas buzzing in the left channel indicates that less anti-skating force is required.\n\n9. Arm Height: Part Two\n\nThus far, the cartridge has been aligned in such a way as to minimize the tracking error across the surface of the record, and the cartridge's azimuth has been set such that the stylus is perpendicular to the surface of the record. The last adjustment we can make in an effort to duplicate the cutter's path through the vinyl disc is to set the angle of the cantilever relative to the record surface to closely approximate that of the original cutter head. This angle, referred to as the vertical tracking angle or VTA, is changed by modifying the height of the tonearm relative to its base. As the arm height is increased, the VTA is increased, and as the arm height is decreased, the VTA is decreased. Most records are cut with a VTA of approximately 22 degrees, although it is not uncommon for a record to be cut with a VTA as low as 18 or as high as 24 degrees.\n\nSetting a cartridge's VTA is best begun by setting the arm tube parallel to the record surface (if you followed my previous advice, you will already have done this prior to aligning the cartridge). If the cartridge manufacturer was clever enough to have angled the cantilever at approximately 22 degrees to the horizontal, then setting the arm tube parallel to the record surface should set the VTA to approximately 22 degrees - just fine for playing back the majority of discs. Unfortunately, cantilevers are not always angled at exactly 22 degrees, so setting the arm tube parallel to the record surface may not result in the correct setting. Since there is no convenient way to measure a cartridge's VTA, the best one can do is experiment with different settings and settle on the one that sounds best to the ear. If you're happy with the sound you're getting with the arm tube parallel to the record surface, then leave it there and spend the rest of your time enjoying your record collection. If you want to experiment with various VTA settings, keep in mind that setting the VTA too high will cause the high frequencies to be accentuated, resulting in a bright, fatiguing presentation. In contrast, setting the VTA too low will cause the low frequencies to be accentuated, resulting in a boomy, sluggish presentation.\n\nOne could spend a good portion of their remaining days on earth tweaking their cartridge's VTA. It will, after all, vary depending on the thickness of each record played. While it's worth investing a reasonable amount of time to find a VTA setting that works well for a representative sample of records in your collection, don't obsess over it. Life's too short, and there's too much music to be heard.\n\n10. Final Adjustments\n\nCongratulations! You're not done yet! Go back and verify that the tracking force, alignment, and azimuth settings haven't been fouled while making other adjustments. Pay particular attention to azimuth, as adjusting the arm height will likely have subtly modified this setting (although it is difficult to visualize in three dimensions, raising the height of a tonearm with an offset headshell will affect the stylus' perpendicularity to the groove).\n\nContinue to listen to your setup and make minor adjustments until you're satisfied with the results. Then put away the alignment and stylus pressure gauges, file away the test records, and kick back with a fist full of your favorite records. I think you'll find that it really was worth all the effort."}, {"question": "I am looking to find a cable and plug assembly for a Shure 51 vintage mic.

This article only applies to Cisco SG350-series and SG350X-series switches. It does not apply to SG200/SG300-series or SG250-series switches.\nDecide how IP Addresses will be managed. It is fine to use DHCP (e.g., from the switch, or from a Crestron server) or Static/Manual addressing. If you are using Static IP Addresses, create a spreadsheet to keep track of each device's address. We suggest tracking the device make, model, MAC Address(es), IP Address(es), firmware version, date purchased, and date installed. Include your switch in the list. See Documenting Your Audio Network for more information.\nUpdate your switch to the latest firmware available from Cisco. This guide was written against SG350-series firmware version 2.5.0.83.\nIf you are using Crestron NVX or other video-over-IP solutions on the same switch, please be sure to complete the additional configuration steps under Configuring a Cisco SG350-series or SG350X-series Switch for Dante and Video.\nConfiguring a Cisco SG350-series or SG350X-series Switch for Shure Dante Devices\nIf you are not using the default subnet of 192.168.1.254 or are not using an external DHCP server, you will need to configure the switch's IP Address to match your Shure Control and Dante network. Under the Administration menu, select Management Interface > IPv4 Interface. Click the Add button, and set an IP address within your Network Audio subnet, set the correct Subnet Mask (Network Mask). Click Apply. The warning will ask if you want to replace the existing IP Address, click OK. Apply changes and reconnect to the switch if needed.\n\n\n\nUnder the Port Management menu, select Green Ethernet > Properties. Ensure Energy Detect Mode and 802.3 Energy Efficient Ethernet is disabled. Verify that all ports show 802.3 as Disabled under the Operational column. Click Apply.\n\nSelect Advanced Configuration Mode in the upper right corner of the screen.\nUnder the Multicast menu, select Properties. Enable Bridge Multicast Filtering. Select IP Group Addresses. Click Apply.\nUnder the Multicast menu, select IPv4 Multicast Configuration > IGMP Snooping menu and enable IGMP Snooping Status and IGMP Querier Status. Click Apply.\nEdit each VLAN in the IGMP Snooping Menu as follows:\nEnable IGMP Snooping Status, MRouter Ports Auto Learn, and Immediate Leave.\nEnable IGMP Querier Status and Querier Election.\nSelect IGMPv2 as the Querier version.\nSelect Auto for Querier Source IP Address. Click Apply.\n\nUnder the Multicast menu, select IPv4 Multicast Configuration > IGMP VLAN Settings and configure each VLAN to have a Querier Interval of 30s and to use IGMPv2. Click Apply for each VLAN.\n\nUnder the Multicast menu, select Multicast Router Port and set all ports to None. This will cause the switch to auto-detect a Multicast Router Port if you have additional switches (see step 15). Click Apply if needed.\nUnder the Multicast menu, select Forward and set all ports to None. This will prevent multicast from flooding all ports. Click Apply if needed.\nUnder the Multicast menu, select Unregistered Multicast. If you are not using any Video-over-IP devices, set all to Forwarding. If you are using Crestron NVX or similar technologies set all to Filtering and be sure to follow the additional instructions at the end of this document. Click Apply if needed.\nUnder the Quality of Service, menu, select QoS Properties. Set mode to Basic. Click Apply if needed.\nUnder the Quality of Service, menu, select QoS Basic Mode > Global Settings. Set Trust Mode to DSCP. Click Apply if needed.\nUnder the Quality of Service, menu, select DSCP to Queue. Set Trust Mode to DSCP. Configure the table to look like the screenshot below with DSCP 56 set to Queue 8, DSCP46 set to Queue 7, DSCP34 set to Queue 6 (or 5, doesn't really matter), and all other DSCP values set to Queue 1. PRO TIP: Tab between each field and use the number keys to set the values, it is much quicker than using the mouse. Click Apply.\nThe switch is now configured. Save the settings and create a backup.\nIf you have a second switch, repeat the configuration procedure for each Cisco switch. We highly advise not mixing switch manufacturers (for example, do not connect a D-Link and a Cisco switch, or use an unmanaged \"dumb\" switch to add additional ports--even if you don't have Dante devices on that device. Here are some tips for a multi-switch environment:\nAll switches should ideally be of the same model series.\nAll switches should share the same general configuration settings as shown above, including enabling the querier\u2014the switches will elect one switch to be the querier. Alternately--you may elect to force one switch to be the querier, and configure all others just for IGMP snooping.\nUplink switches with the fastest physical layer method possible. If there is video traffic, we highly recommend a 10 Gbps uplink between switches. In some cases \nEnsure the uplink ports on downstream switches indicate as a Dynamic router port on the Multicast Router Port screen. The core switch will not show links to other switches as Dynamic; this is expected and normal. Do not set this to Static; this will cause all multicast to flood that link.\nIf no video is present, ensure uplink ports are set to Forward Unregistered Multicast Traffic on the Unregistered Multicast screen. If video is present, follow the additional instructions at the end of this document and ensure all links to child switches are set to forward the Dante traffic.\nExplicitly block multicast clock traffic (224.0.1.129) from any attached WiFi access points.\nConfiguring a Cisco SG350-series or SG350X-series Switch for Dante and Video\nIf you plan to use your SG350-series or SG350X-series switch with Crestron NVX equipment or other video-over-IP equipment, follow these additional configuration instructions.\nUnder the Multicast menu, select Unregistered Multicast. Set all ports to Filtering.\nUnder the Multicast menu, select IP Multicast Group Addresses. Add the following groups to the list:\n224.0.0.230\n224.0.0.231\n224.0.0.232\n224.0.0.233\n224.0.0.251\n224.0.1.129\n\n\nSelect each of the groups above one at a time, and click Details. Select Static for all switchports with a Shure or Dante device attached. It is perfectly fine to assign Static for all switchports. Repeat for each of the six groups listed above.\nVerifying Your Work\nConnect all of your Shure devices to the network switch, and if necessary, assign them a Static IP address.\nOpen Dante Controller and ensure all devices appear under the Device Info tab.\nVerify that only one device is the Leader Clock on the Clock Status tab. All other devices should say Follower. If you are using AES67, we generally recommend that the same device serve as both the Dante and AES67 Leader Clock.\nOpen Shure Update Utility, and configure it to use your Ethernet adaptor.

Do they act as earplugs too? Are they too loud right up close to your ear? See my family has a history of hearing loss, and I hate using earplugs cause then I can't hear the music, so how would these help with that problem.", "answer": "Answer\nThe main purpose of personal monitors is to hear yourself better. But it doesn\u2019t do any good if you can\u2019t hear at all. As mentioned earlier, volume wars on stage are a universal problem. Prolonged exposure to extremely high sound pressure levels can quickly cause hearing to deteriorate. Some performers have taken to wearing ear plugs to protect their hearing, but even the best ear plugs cause some alteration of frequency response. Personal monitors offer a level of hearing protection equal to that of ear plugs, but with the additional benefit of tiny loudspeakers in the plugs. The monitoring level is now in the hands of the performer. If it seems to be too loud, there is no excuse for not turning the monitors down to a comfortable level. The use of an onboard limiter is strongly recommended to prevent high level transients from causing permanent damage. In larger, complex monitor rigs, outboard compressors and limiters are often employed to offer a greater degree of control and protection.\n\nNOTE: Using a personal monitor system does not guarantee that you will not or can not suffer hearing damage. These systems are capable of producing levels in excess of 130 dB SPL. Prolonged exposure to these kinds of levels can cause hearing damage. It is up to the individual user to be responsible for protecting his or her own hearing.\n\nMore info on page 12 and pages 25-26: Selection and Operation of Personal Monitor Systems"}, {"question": "Which microphone would be best for the following application: Approximately 4 ft. round table; min. of two persons, with as many as 5 persons at table; relatively quiet surroundings; base of mic perhaps hidden in a flower arrangement; hard wired ok..have existing 3 pin hookups.

The typical input impedance of a pro-audio device is often in the 10,000 to 20,000 Ohm range.  Connecting a low impedance output driver to a typical medium impedance input provides excellent signal voltage transfer and very good signal to noise ratio performance.  If two low impedance driver outputs are wired directly together as a \"Y\" connection to combine their signals, it will probably work. The complication is that each output driver stage will load each other unnecessarily due their very low impedance.  To combine two low impedance outputs together, bridging resistors are recommended to provide some isolation between the output drivers."}, {"question": "This was inherited and is in great condition.

All things being equal, which typically causes more loss of the RF signal?", "answer": "Answer\nRF signal loss due to the length of the cable run is far more significant than loss due to an impedance mismatch. Using a 100 foot run of 75 ohm antenna cable with low loss is better than using a 100 foot run of 50 ohm antenna cable with high loss. There are different grades of 75 ohm cable and of 50 ohm cable. Check with the cable manufacturer to determine the loss per 100 feet for the cable grade being considered.\n\nProfessional wireless microphone antennas are 50 ohms, and therefore 50 ohm cable is preferred. If 75 ohm cable is used, add 0.4 dB of loss for this impedance mismatch, no matter the length of the cable run. For example, a 100 foot run of 75 ohm RG6U has a loss of 6 dB (at 500 MHz) when used with a 75 ohm antenna. When used with a 50 ohm antenna, the loss is 6.4 dB [6 dB + 0.4 dB for the impedance mismatch.]"}, {"question": "Does the 55SW model require phantom power before plugging into the amp or PA?", "answer": "Answer\nNo. The \"power source\" is an internal permanent magnet.

Try this experiment. If you have a portable FM radio, tune in a station and do a 360 degree spin. Note how the station fades as you turn your body.\n\nPositioning a large human body between the transmitter's antenna and the receiver's antenna can cause a degradation in RF performance. The human body is made up primarily of \"salt water.\"  Salt water is an effective absorber of RF energy.  (Submarines have to surface to send FM radio signals.)   The more body fat a person has, the more RF is absorbed.   Our tests show that a body pack transmitter can be 50 to 70% less effective than a handheld transmitter simply because of the antenna location being against the human body. Thus the reason RF antennas in theatres are often placed above the stage...closer to the actors wearing the body packs.\n\nAttached is an excellent technical paper (PDF file) on this subject from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology."}, {"question": "I have a Technics SL-J33 with a Shure P mount V15 cartridge.

This means that the styli are not interchangeable from one generation to the next. They do not provide a proper fit, or alignment, between the Magnet and Pole Pieces.\n\nIn general, it has been Shure\u2019s practice to provide a replacement stylus for premium products for 10 years beyond a particular product\u2019s discontinuation. This is typically accomplished by estimating a 10 year demand, and producing that quantity, before the tooling and assembly line is retired. In some cases we under estimated, in some cases we over estimated.\n\nIn 1983, Shure introduced the Micro-Ridge (MR) diamond for the V15 Type V. Shure also offered the Micro-Ridge diamond on replacement styli for V15 Type III and Type IV. Again, long term quantities were estimated and produced. Circumstantially, the tooling for the V15 Type V allowed for additional production of Type III replacement styli. This accounts for the larger availability of Type III and Type V replacement styli.\n\nShure experienced dramatic shifts in demand for phono cartridges when the CD Player was introduced in the late 1980\u2019s. In the early 1990\u2019s cartridge sales plummeted, OEM business ceased, and Shure gave serious consideration to ending all phono production.\n\nIn 1995, under new phono management, Shure re-engineered our phono products and manufacturing process to allow us to produce significantly lower quantities, maintain our quality standards, locate reliable suppliers, and maintain a fair market price. The action allowed Shure to remain in the phono cartridge business, but unfortunately, required that we cease to support pre-1995 products beyond the final inventory build-ups.\n\nFor V15 products, a replacement stylus was available for at least 5 year after the cartridge was officially discontinued. Some inventory usually remained in the retail channel for 2-3 years.\n\nShure\u2019s inventory of VN45E, VN45HE, and VN45MR styli completely expired in the late 1990\u2019s.

Could you please give me an explanation?", "answer": "Answer\nAttack refers to the transient response of the mic.\n\nA good way to understand why dynamic and condenser mics sound different is to understand the differences in their transient response.\n\nIn order for a microphone to convert sound energy into electrical energy, the sound wave must physically move the diaphragm of the microphone. The speed of this movement depends on the weight or mass of the diaphragm.  For instance, the diaphragm and voice coil assembly of a dynamic microphone may have up to 1000 times the mass of the diaphragm of a condenser microphone. The lightweight condenser diaphragm starts moving much more quickly than the dynamic\u2019s diaphragm. It also takes longer for the dynamic\u2019s diaphragm to stop moving in comparison to the condenser\u2019s diaphragm. Thus, the dynamic\u2019s transient response is not as good as the condenser\u2019s transient response. This is similar to two vehicles in traffic: a truck and a sports car. They may have engines of equal power, but the truck weighs much more than the car. As traffic flow changes, the sports car can accelerate and brake very quickly, while the semi accelerates and brakes very slowly due to its greater weight.  Both vehicles follow the overall traffic flow but the sports car responds better to sudden changes. 38 The picture below is of two studio microphones responding to the sound impulse produced by an electric spark:  condenser mic on top, dynamic mic on bottom. It is evident that it takes almost twice as long for the dynamic microphone to respond to the sound. It also takes longer for the dynamic to stop moving after the impulse has passed (notice the ripple on the second half of the graph). Since condenser microphones generally have better transient response then dynamics, they are better suited for instruments that have very sharp attacks or extended high frequency output such as cymbals. It is this transient response difference that causes condenser mics to have a more crisp, detailed sound and dynamic mics to have a more mellow, rounded sound.\n \nCondenser/dynamic scope photo\n "}, {"question": "Where can I find the schematics for the XLR connections to achieve Polarity Cancellation?

Unfortunately, there is no standard to which camcorder manufacturers must adhere, and the specifications provided with the camcorder often say little or nothing about the microphone input. Most camcorder microphone inputs fall into one of three groups, however; the trick is knowing which group your camcorder is in. The key questions are:\nIs the camcorder mono or stereo? If it is stereo, we assume that you wish to record the audio from your microphone onto both the Left and Right channels. This is commonly the case for most Mirrorless and DSLR cameras on the market.\nIf it is mono, does the microphone input jack supply DC voltage (sometimes labeled Mic Power or +3 vdc) for the manufacturer's own accessory microphone? This DC voltage is not the same as the phantom power used for professional condenser microphones. Microphones or wireless receivers that do not require this power must be connected in such a way as to avoid contact with it. Professional condenser microphones requiring phantom power cannot be directly connected to a camcorder; a separate phantom power supply is required.\nIf the camcorder is stereo, are there separate mono input jacks for the Left and Right channels, or a single stereo input jack that feeds both channels? If there are separate mono jacks, do they supply DC power (see above)?\nIs a transformer necessary?\nIf the length of cable between the microphone and the camcorder will be 20 feet or less, all that is necessary is to use a cable with the appropriate connectors and wiring. If the cable will be longer than 20 feet, however, a transformer will be required at the end of the cable nearest the camcorder. The camcorder-side of the transformer is typically equipped with a very short cable and a 3.5mm mono or stereo connector. The transformer provides two benefits:\nThe transformer maintains a balanced connection between itself and the microphone, minimizing pickup of hum and electromagnetic interference and allowing for cable runs of up to 1,000 feet. (Longer cable runs require a mixer or preamplifier to boost the microphone signal up to Line level, about 1 volt.)\nThe transformer can boost the signal level slightly, which may be useful when connecting a low-output microphone (or one used at a considerable distance from the sound source) to a camcorder whose microphone input is not very sensitive. The amount of boost (called gain) that the transformer provides depends on the ratio between its input and output impedances, as well as the ratio between the transformers output impedance and the camcorders input impedance. Typical transformers provide between 6 dB and 12 dB of gain.\nCan a mixer be connected to the camcorder?\nThe output of a mixer can be connected to a camcorder's Mic input if the mixer has a Mic level output. If the mixer only has a Line level output, its level must be attenuated (decreased) by approximately 50 dB to prevent overloading of the camcorder's microphone input circuitry. Some camcorders have a Line level input in addition to the Mic input.\nIf the cable run from the mixer to the camcorder is longer than 20 feet, a transformer is required as discussed previously. Note: the mixer must have a Mic level output, OR the transformer must be capable of handling a Line level signal from the mixer without being overloaded (most cannot).\nAutomatic Gain Control\nMost consumer-grade camcorders and some industrial models have an Automatic Gain Control (AGC), which adjusts the audio level up or down as necessary. The AGC circuit is designed to compensate for the fact that the sound source is often far from the microphone on the camera. An external microphone is usually placed much closer to the source, however, and therefore a much higher signal level is fed into the camera's input. The Automatic Gain Control responds by rapidly reducing the audio level during the peaks of speech, and boosting the level up very high during pauses. The sound of the AGCs action is often described as pumping, breathing, or whooshing, and is usually undesirable.\nHow to reduce the effects of AGC\nIt is impossible to defeat or bypass the AGC on most camcorders. The only other options are:\nUse the camcorders line-level input, if it has one. On most camcorders, the line input is not affected by the AGC. But since a microphone signal is not strong enough to drive the line input directly, the mic must be connected to a mixer or microphone preamplifier that has a line level output. Using a mixer also allows for more precise adjustment and metering of signal levels, in addition to its basic function of combining the signals from multiple microphones into one feed.\nKeep the external mic signal level very low. This causes the AGC to relax and let the audio level rise to maximum. This tends to amplify the hiss of the cameras audio circuitry, but reduces the pumping action. The microphones output signal can be reduced by moving it farther away from the source, or by using a device called an attenuator or pad, which decreases the signal level by a fixed amount. Some attenuators offer a choice of settings, such as -15 dB, -20 dB, and -25 dB.\nSources\nInterfaces\nBeachtek: Makes many XLR to 1/8\" adapter boxes with volume controls and mixing functions.\nAdapter Cables\nMarkertek 800-522-2025\nSC10XJMZ: microphone cable with female XLR connector on mic end and 3.5mm stereo miniplug on camcorder end.

When do I need to use it?", "answer": "Answer\nProper antenna distribution is key to achieving optimum performance from multiple wireless systems operating in the same environment. Our Wireless Accessory Wizard will tell you when an antenna distribution system is recommended, and how to hook it up. Here are some of the benefits of antenna distribution:\nStacking or rack mounting wireless receivers results in many closely spaced antennas, which is not only unsightly and a physical challenge, but also degrades the performance of the wireless systems.\nAntennas spaced less than 1/4 wavelength apart (about 12 cm / 5 inches at 600 MHz) disrupt the pickup patterns of one another, resulting in erratic coverage.\nClosely spaced antennas can aggravate local oscillator bleed, which is a potential source of interference between closely spaced receivers. This is particularly problematic on older analog systems.\nAntenna distribution is essential to keeping the number of remote antennas and coaxial cable runs to a minimum.\nThe antenna distribution unit can often power the wireless mic receivers, reducing the number of power outlets required.\nAntenna distribution eliminates these issues by splitting the signal from a single pair of antennas to feed multiple receivers. This split can be accomplished by either passive or active means.\n\nPassive Splitters (2 receivers)\nPassive splitters are inexpensive and do not require any power to operate. Using a passive splitter results in a signal loss of about 3 dB for every split. As a general rule, no more than 5 dB of loss is acceptable between the antennas and the receiver inputs. For this reason, passive splitters should only be used for a single split (i.e., splitting a single antenna to two receivers). An additional consideration with passive splitters is the presence of DC voltage on the antenna inputs of some receivers. This voltage is usually present for powering remote antenna amplifiers directly off a receiver. If two receivers are connected together with a passive splitter, each receiver will \u201csee\u201d the voltage from the other receiver at its antenna inputs. Depending on the design of the receiver, this may be a problem. To avoid any potential damage, either use a splitter that incorporates circuitry to block the voltage (such as the Shure UA221), use an external DC blocker, or defeat the voltage on at least one of the receivers.\n\nThis diagram shows how to share a single pair of antennas with two receivers:\n\n\nActive Antenna Distribution (3 or more receivers)\nIf distribution is needed for more than two systems, an active antenna distribution system is recommended. Active splitters require power to operate, but provide make-up gain to compensate for the additional losses resulting from multiple splits off the same antennas. A typical active system will have 4-5 antenna outputs. Many active antenna distribution systems will provide power distribution to the receivers as well. Multiple active distribution systems can be used together if more outputs are needed, but this must be done carefully. A theoretically perfect distribution system would provide unity gain from input to output. In practice, the antenna outputs of an active system may have as much as 1.5 - 2 dB of gain. Over-amplification of the radio signal can cause unwanted side effects, such as aggravated intermodulation products and increased radio \u201cnoise\u201d. To prevent these problems, it is strongly recommended to not cascade antenna distribution systems more than two deep. A better method is to use a \"primary\" antenna distribution system to split the signal to a second tier of \u201csecondary\u201d distribution systems. All receivers are then connected to either the \u201cprimary\u201d or \u201csecondary\u201d distribution systems. Connecting receivers in this manner keeps all the receivers closer to the pure antenna signal. Pay attention to the frequency bandwidth specified for the antenna distribution system. They are typically available in both wideband and narrowband varieties. Wideband refers to a device that will pass frequencies over a large range, typically several hundred megahertz. \u201cNarrowband\u201d devices may be limited to no more than 20 or 30 MHz. Since these are active devices, frequencies outside the bandwidth of the distribution system will not pass on to the receivers.\n\nThis diagram shows how to use a \"primary\" and \"secondary\" antenna distribution unit:\n\nWhat kind of distribution should I use?\n2 receivers: Use a passive antenna splitter\n4 - 5 receivers: Use a single active antenna distribution systems\nMore than 5 receivers: Use multiple active systems connected in a hierarchical arrangement\nTry our Wireless Accessory Wizard to more closely model your exact system and get a bill of materials to order."}, {"question": "Are there any historic SM7 advertising fliers?

From the center terminal (ground), run a wire directly to XLR pin 1.\n\nIf you want the on/off switch to function, wire it in parallel to XLR pins 2 and 3. Have the switch short pins 2 and 3 together when the mic is to be \"off\"; and unshort pins 2 and 3 when the mic is to be \"on\".\n\nCheck the polarity of each rewired PE588 against an SM57. Connect the PE588 into mixer input #1; connect the SM57 into mixer input #2. Set the input controls on both channels to be the same. Talk into one mic; then talk into the other mic; then bring both mics close together and talk into both at the same time.\n\nIf the polarity on the rewired PE588 is correct, the mixer output level will go up slightly when talking into both mics. If the polarity is incorrect, the output level will decrease significantly. In this case, remove the PE588 XLR connector and reverse the wires soldered to pins 2 and 3.\n   "}, {"question": "I am trying to rebuild an old PE588 handheld mic.

Which model of your wireless microphones will work on all four floors, if the receiver is placed on any one of the floors?", "answer": "Answer\nThat depends on how large the floors are, the construction material used in the floors, the construction material used in the walls, how much background RF radiation there is, etc. We cannot guarantee that any or our systems would work in the manner that you described. For penetration through walls, the UHF system would work the best. It's actually the small wavelength of the frequency that is most beneficial. You should take one of these systems to the building to try it and see how the performance is. If the system does not cover all the floors, then you may need to have 2 pairs of antennas that get combined through a UA221 splitter/combiner. In this manner, you could place 1 antenna on each of the 4 levels of the store. This should provide adequate coverage.\n\nYou can also place a receiver on each floor of the store. These 4 receivers would need to be on the same frequency.

What exactly does breaking in/or wearing in mean and how do I do a proper breakin-in of a phono-needle (like the Shure M44G) ?", "answer": "Answer\nThe Book of Shure\n\nYour Guide to the Proper Use of Shure DJ Products\n\nby The Needlz Brotherz\n\nEvery DJ touches the record in a slightly different way. With the Shure DJ Cartridge family, you are sure to find the needle to fit your spinning needs. However, optimum cartridge performance may require some experimentation to adapt to your personal touch. Here's a quick guide through the ins and outs of optimal cartridge care.\n\nChapter 1\n\nAccelerating Break-In (M44-7)\nNormal break-in time takes about two weeks. The bearing, a critical part of the stylus suspension system, is stiff from the factory. Skip resistance improves with use.\nYou can speed up the break in period by leaving the cartridge in the record groove, with the turntable turned off, for two hours each night letting nature (gravity) do its thing.\nChapter 2\n\nStandard Hi-Fi\nAttach cartridge to headshell using screws, washer, and nut.\nAlign the cartridge so that the diamond is even with the edge of the headshell. (Technics owners may use the white Stylus Overhang Gauge). The stylus overhang should be approximately 52mm.\nSet the tone arm height so the arm is level, or only slightly downward.\nSet anti-skate to zero.\nZero the tone arm.\nAdd 3 -3.5grams of weight.\n  DJ Variation\nFollow guidelines for Standard Hi-Fi.\nPull the cartridge back 1 - 2 mm in headshell.\nYou may opt to include headshell weight. This adds more mass to the tone arm and provides increased stability for some DJs.\nZero the tone arm and add three grams. When using the headshell weight, avoid the tendency to increase tracking force unnecessarily.\n  Unorthodox Variation\nThis technique is chosen by some DJs. Try your preference of Standard or DJ variation.\nRemove the tone arm counter weight and install it backward.\nSlowly add weight until you get the desired skip resistance.\nThis procedure adds 2 grams to the tracking force range. We do not recommend that you push the counterweight completely forward.\nChapter 3\n\n23 Degree Trick \nSome DJs increase skip resistance by angling the cartridge away from the spindle 23 degrees.\nThis technique emulates a straight tone arm.\nThe outer groove wall will wear slightly faster than the inner groove wall.\nChapter 4\n\nHow to Zero The Tone Arm\nStop the platter.\nInstall the cartridge.\nTwist the counterweight as far back as possible. The tone arm should be pointing up.\nSlowly twist the counterweight forward until the tone arm/cartridge barely floats above the record. (Think of the balance scale from science class.)\nHold the counterweight still and twist the dial to zero.\nThe tone arm now has \"zero\" weight.\nSlowly twist the counterweight inward until the dial indicates your desired tracking force.\nChapter 5\n\nTone Arm Height\nTone arm height should be level or only slightly down. This allows for proper stylus alignment in the record groove.\nIf the tone arm is too high, the angle of contact where the diamond touches the groove changes shape. A spherical stylus may touch the groove at an angle resembling an elliptical stylus.\nIf the tone arm is too high, the diamond tip can be pulled behind the curve of the record groove. This requires the cartridge to be positioned forward in the headshell.\nChapter 6\n\nStylus Overhang\nStylus overhang is the distance between the diamond and the inner cuff on the headshell.\nOptimum overhang for accurate listening on an S shaped tone arm is 52mm (Technics 1200s). On Vestax PDX-2000 straight arms, optimum overhang is 50mm.\nOptimum overhang positions the diamond slightly forward of the curve in the record groove, and has in inward pull on the tone arm.\nThe diamond is seated evenly between the left and right walls of the record groove.\nPositioning the stylus at the tangent point of the record groove can increase Skip resistance.\nActual optimum overhang position will vary with tone arm height and scratch technique.\nChapter 7\n\nAnti-Skate \nS Shaped tone arms have a natural pull towards the inside of the record.\nAnti-skate is a tone arm feature that exerts an outward push away from the spindle.\nAnti-skate has two calibration settings. The dial at the base of the tone arm is a relative setting that adds 1-3 grams of outward force. Absolute Anti-Skate force is adjusted using the two concentric screws on top of the pivot joint. Shure recommends that a qualified turntable technician perform adjustments for Absolute Anti-Skate.\nTest for Anti-Skate calibration.\nZero the tone arm.\nSet Anti-skate to Zero.\nIf the tone arm pulls outward, a positive anti-skate force exists. Seek a turntable technician for calibration.\nIf the tone arm pulls inward, a negative anti-skate force exists. Add force using the dial until the tone arm floats freely, with no inward or outward pull.\nPositive anti-skating forces increase skipping when back cueing.\nChapter 8\n\nTone Arm Variation (S vs. Straight)\nS shaped tone arms (Technics 1200) position the diamond slightly in front of the curve in the record groove. S shaped tone arms have a natural inward pull, which can be off-set with anti-skate.\nStraight tone arms (Vestax PDX2000) are designed to place the needle perfectly tangent to the curve in the record groove. By design, the straight arm has no natural inward or outward force on the tone arm.\nChapter 9\\\n\nStylus Geometry\nSpherical - The diamond is shaped like an upside down traffic cone. The front view and side view are equal. Spherical diamonds have the largest surface contact with the record groove, resulting in lower pressure per square inch, lower record wear, and acceptance of heavier tracking forces.\nElliptical - The diamond is shaped like an oval traffic cone. The front view is 3 times wider than the side view. Elliptical diamonds have smaller surface contact and higher pressure per square inch. Elliptical diamonds yield more accurate high frequency response, but are NOT suitable for scratching.\nChapter 10\n\nCleaning the Stylus \nThe stylus should be cleaned with a miniature brush and warm water.\nAlways pull the brush long ways from back to front.\nNever brush side to side, as this will damage the cantilever.\nOver time, dirt that has not been removed can harden on the stylus, changing its shape and reducing performance.\nChapter 11\n\nQuick Fix Skip Checklist\nTracking force? Too much?\nStylus overhang?\nTone arm height?\nAnti-skate?\nBreak-in time?\nChapter 12\n\nNon-Needle Skipping Factors\nLoose tone arm assembly.\nLoose spindle hole on the record.\nSlip mat.\nUnstable table.\nViolent, yet unrefined, scratch /juggle technique."}, {"question": "I came into a supply of boxes while cleaning out a relative's estate.

Is there any way to reset the transmitter or update the firmware?", "answer": "Answer\nULX-D transmitters displaying FPGA ERR! can usually be restored by updating the firmware again without changing the receiver's firmware version. Follow these steps:\nLocate a microphone stand or music stand on which you can place the transmitter so that it is 4\u201d \u2013 6\u201d from the receiver\u2019s IR port. It is very important that you keep the transmitter still during the update process to avoid an interruption, which can corrupt the firmware. We do not recommend holding the transmitter in your hands because the IR signal may get interrupted.\nPlace the handheld or bodypack transmitter on the stand you found in Step 2 and align the transmitter and receiver IR ports. The IR port on the transmitter should face the IR port on the receiver, about 4\" - 6\" away.\nBegin the update process. On the receiver, press ENTER, use knob to scroll to DEVICE UTILITIES, press ENTER, scroll to TX FW UPDATE, and press ENTER.\nWhen the two are aligned, the IR port on the receiver will illuminate red.\nPress ENTER on the receiver to begin the download to the transmitter. Do not move the transmitter. IR ports must be aligned for the entire download, which can take 50 seconds or longer.\nIf the update fails, attempt it a few more times.\nIn a very limited set of circumstances where a transmitter was being updated from version 1.5.6 or earlier to a new firmware version, and the IR update was interrupted during a particular part of the FPGA update, the transmitter may refuse to accept a firmware update using the procedure described above and will continue to display FPGA ERR!. In these cases, it is sometimes possible to recover the transmitter using an older ULX-D receiver running firmware 1.5.6 or earlier. Not all receivers can run firmware 1.5.6.\n\nIf your receiver is in the J50A, L50A, V50 or X52 band or the receiver has a hardware revision of Rev1 (or later), you will be unable to follow the instructions below. To determine the hardware revision of the receiver, navigate to the Device Utilities menu and navigate to Version. There will be a field called HW. Rev0 receivers can be reverted to firmware earlier than 2.3.x, but Rev1 (and later) receivers cannot. If you are unable to follow the instructions below, contact Shure Applications Engineering for further guidance on this FPGA error issue.\n\nIMPORTANT! There is some risk in \"rolling back\" a ULXD4D or ULXD4Q receiver to firmware version 1.5.6. In some circumstances, you may not be able to restore the receiver to later firmware easily. Please be sure to follow the steps in ULX-D Firmware Update and Issues to change the firmware version of a ULXD4D or ULXD4Q receiver.\n\nIf the ULX-D receiver has hardware revision Rev0 and it is in the G50, H50, J50 or L50 band, you may be able to recover a ULX-D transmitter which cannot otherwise be recovered with normal firmware updates from a receiver on recent firmware.\nDownload ULX-D firmware version 1.5.6 (June 2014) for the receiver that you have. This will be either ULXD4, ULXD4D Dual or ULXD4Q Quad.\nUse an Ethernet cable to connect your Mac or PC directly to the network port of the ULX-D receiver. Do not attempt firmware updates via WiFi.\nRun SUU and ensure the receiver appears under Update Devices. If it does not appear, see Shure Update Utility: Devices Don't Display.\nClick on the Firmware tab, and at the bottom, click Import. Select the files and open them. SUU will import them.\nClick on the Update Devices Double-click the Version to install column next to the receiver line and select 1.5.6.\nUnselect the checkbox next to the transmitter line for each receiver. You must leave the newer (2.x.x) transmitter firmware in this field.\nClick Send Updates. Do not turn off the receiver(s) until the update is complete. Once the transfer is complete, the receiver automatically begins the firmware update, which overwrites the existing old firmware with version 1.5.6.\nOnce this completes and the receiver reboots, turn on the ULXD1 or ULXD2 displaying FPGA ERR!.\nLocate a microphone stand or music stand on which you can place the transmitter so that it is 4\u201d \u2013 6\u201d from the receiver\u2019s IR port.

Do not move the transmitter. IR ports must be aligned for the entire download, which can take 50 seconds or longer.\nIf the update fails or seems to complete after only 30 seconds or so, the update was unsuccessful and you should try again. You may need to attempt the update multiple times.\nAfter successfully updating the transmitter, use the Shure Update Utility to update the firmware on the receiver to 2.0.28 and then to the latest version. Please carefully follow the instructions here: ULX-D Firmware Update and Issues. IMPORTANT: Do not attempt to update directly from 1.5.6 to the latest firmware!\nIf this process doesn't seem to work after a few attempts or you find it too confusing, please feel free to contact our Applications Engineering Department at 312-736-6006 (M-F) and we will be happy to assist."}, {"question": "I recently obtained one of your old (Discontinued) \"Monoplex\" Crystal microphones and I'm trying to find a microphone cable that I can use to test and use the microphone with.

Or, is there another, more-readily-available battery that will fit these mikes?", "answer": "Answer\nAn external phantom power supply should operate the SM82 in a quiet manner.\n\nIn 1975, Shure made the A82BA battery adapter that stacked seven 1.5 volt cells in series, thus providing a 10.5 battery. We no longer make this adapter but you might be able to fabricate one yourself."}, {"question": "I have two of these microphones which I use for football & baseball coverage in stadiums. These microphones can be powered either by phantom power from the console or by an internal battery. The original Eveready 177 battery provides 9.8 volts, this is a mercury battery & has been discontinued due to environmental issues. Presently we've rigged some watch batteries in a cardboard tube but would like to find a better solution?", "answer": "Answer\nThe 9.8 volt mercury battery used in the SM82 microphone (Duracell TR177) has been discontinued due to environmental constraints on the use of mercury. A company called Exell makes the only replacement battery that comes close to the specifications. The replacement battery is rated at 10.5 volts. This new battery is a retrofit but could cause damage to the zener diode in the SM82 circuit.\n\nAlthough the SM82 can be powered via 12-52 volts of phantom, using any internal battery with greater than 10.5 volts actual voltage is \"dangerous territory\". The 11-volt, 5% tolerance zener diode in the microphone helps protect the SM82's condenser circuitry. But if the battery exceeds the 10.5-11 volt maximum, the SM82 will begin to draw excessive current from the internal battery. This will most likely damage the zener diode, thus making the microphone susceptible to further damage if use with phantom power.\n\nShure's position is that no matter the rated voltage of a battery (most new batteries exceed their rated voltage), the measured voltage of any SM82 replacement battery should be 10.5 volts maximum.\n\nThe best course is to use the Exell battery after slightly discharging it. This can be done by putting a 1/2 watt, 500 ohm resistor across the terminals for a few minutes until the voltage goes to 10.5v. Then it should be safe to use. http://www.exellbattery.com/"}, {"question": "A customer of mine asked me three questions regarding his SM82: What was the retail cost? Are they phantom powered?

I read the manual, but I'm not really sure what all that means.", "answer": "Answer\n1) The headphone jack on the FP33 is controlled by the headphone volume control on the front. Simply turn up the headphone volume control on the FP33 so that it matches the Sony output. If the mixer signal going to the headphones is then too loud (when you take it off of monitor), simply adjust the \"Level R Pot\" and \"Level L Pot\" inside the FP33.

Use balanced cables whenever possible."}, {"question": "How do I correctly use lavalier microphones in theater applications?", "answer": "Answer\nThe object of most theatrical microphone techniques is to make the mics as inconspicuous as possible and provide the actors with freedom of movement, while still providing a high level of sound quality. The obvious choice is wireless lavalier microphones, which are becoming increasingly popular. Today it is common to find Broadway productions that incorporate twenty to thirty wireless microphone systems on a nightly basis. This document will present a few tips and techniques to get the best results from lavalier microphones.\n\nPlace the microphone near the top of the chest, above the ear, or in the hair line. A common mistake is to place the mic near the throat, but this will lead to an unnatural sound due to a \u201cshadow\u201d created by the chin that will block high frequencies from reaching the microphone.\n\nUse an omni-directional mic if you have to position it above the ear or in the hair line. A side-effect of directional mics (cardioid, supercardioid, etc.) is off-axis coloration. A mic placed on the head will, of course, always be off-axis unless it is right in front of the mouth. Omni mics will sound more natural when placed away from the mouth.\n\nConsult the wig master on securing mics near the hair line. Mic cables can be secured in the hair in several ways, including wig clips, comb clips, sewing them into barrettes, bobby pins, and elastic headbands. Also, the mic can be mounted on the temple of eyeglasses.\n\nNever use \"Gaffer\" tape to secure a cable to the skin. The adhesive found on this tape can cause skin irritation, as well as just being too sticky. Suggested alternatives include surgical tape, spirit gum, medical adhesive, and clear bandage tape.\n\nBe sure to provide strain-relief for the mic cable behind the neck. The point where the neck bends needs to be the most secure. If no strain relief is present, a sharp neck movement could tug the mic out of place. Again, surgical tape and elastic headbands are good choices for securing the mic cable to the neck.\n\nBe careful not to get make-up in the opening of the microphone element. Any make-up that gets into the mic element will alter the frequency response, and could destroy the element altogether.\n\nIf the mic cable is run inside clothing, tape the mic and cable to the fabric to prevent contact noise. Contact noise is caused by clothing rubbing against the mic capsule or cable. A little tape and some careful positioning can help eliminate this problem. Also, tie a simple knot in the mic cable near the microphone. This will also assist in blocking cable noise from getting into the microphone.\n\nConsult the wardrobe master to help prevent clothing noise. Clothing noise is caused by garments rubbing against each other. There is no practical way to shield the mic from this noise, so it is a good idea to plan ahead with your wardrobe people. Generally, synthetic materials make more noise than natural fabrics, such as cotton. Also, ask wardrobe to tape or sew together multiple layers of clothing to prevent rustling.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to use equalization. Judicial use of high frequency boost can help brighten a mic that is covered by clothing or positioned in the hair line. Low frequency cut reduces cable noise, breath pops, and wind noise.\n\nKeep spare mics on hand at all times. Many professional theater companies consider lavalier microphones a disposable item. Condenser microphones especially can be easily destroyed in such an abusive environment. Sweat, make-up, and constant tugging on cables and connectors can quickly wear out even the highest-quality microphone. Try to inspect your mics on a regular basis by plugging them in and listening for any odd noises and crackling, or degradation of frequency response. Wiggle the cables and connectors to check for loose connections.\n\nTake the headworn approach. More and more, actors in Broadway musicals use headworn microphones. The mic placement is always consistent, and right in front of the mouth for best sound quality and better gain before feedback. Headworn mics also give you that \u201chip, 21st century\u201d look!\n\nAdditional Reading:\n  Sound Design in the Theatre;\nJohn L.

Condenser microphones have circuitry either internal like our Beta 87A or PGA81 or sometimes its external to allow the microphone to be small. While in some instances there is a little amplification in the \"preamp\" section of the microphone, its main purpose is to adapt the high impedance unbalanced signal from the microphone element to a low impedance balanced signal output that can handle phantom power from the mixing board.\n\nYou will still need \"mic preamps\", so keep the Neve's."}, {"question": "I'm looking for a tie-clip single-mount mic clip to use on an SM84 Lav mic.

Also involved is that coiled spring part that the patch cord goes through before entering the connector. I can see that I have to solder some wire or wires to it.( For ground?) What gets soldered to what for high Z?", "answer": "Answer\nWe can tell you what pins to use at the microphone connector. Your 545 microphone has a four pin MC4F Amphenol connector. Pins 1 and 2 of this connector are the high impedance output. Pin 2 is the hot. To wire this output for a quarter inch connector, connect pin 1 to the sleeve (ground or shield) and pin 2 to the tip of the connector. The mating connector to the MC4F is Amphenol's part MC4M.\n\nIf you have the original Shure cable that was offered with the mic, the shield would go to the sleeve of the 1/4 inch connector and the red to the tip. The other two conductors remain un-connected.\n\nFor further information, Pins 3 and 4 are the low impedance balanced output. Pin 4 is the plus (XLR pin 2), pin 3 is the minus (XLR pin 3), and Pin 1 is the ground or shield.\n\n* NOTE: It is recommended that the polarity of the 545 be checked after the XLR cable is fabricated. If the polarity is reversed when compared to other mics, like the Shure SM57 or Shure SM58, reverse the wiring of XLR pin 2 and XLR pin 3 on the 545 cable.\n\nShure do not carry Amphenol connectors, but pre-wired cables are available from Tom Ellis - U.S. phone: 214-328-3225 or email: tellis@ellisandassoc.com.\n   "}, {"question": "I have an old wireless lapel system and want to know if I can adapt a headworn mic instead of the tieclip mic.

Can I use it in other countries?", "answer": "Answer\nYou can, but if caught you might be fined, have your wireless system confiscated, arrested, or imprisoned depending on the country...maybe all four. This is not an exaggerated statement.\n\nWhy? I am just an innocent musician!\n\nEach country has unique regulations regarding the wireless transmission of signals and these regulations are drafted, implemented, and modified by each country's government, not by an international organization. These regulations apply to TV signals, AM and FM radio signals, two-way radio communication, and even your Shure wireless system, be it a wireless mic or a wireless in-ear monitor. Violations of these regulations, no matter how insignificant, are taken quite seriously by the government agencies that enforce them.\n\nPlease explain\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates wireless transmission within the borders of the U.S. The FCC has decreed that wireless microphones may operate in the same frequency bands as U.S. VHF TV channels 7 - 13 and U.S. UHF TV channels 14 - 36. Wireless microphones are accepted in these frequency bands as long as they meet FCC specifications and do not cause interference to any TV signal. If the wireless microphone does cause interference (highly unlikely), it must cease operation.\n\nOther countries have similar agencies and within each country's borders these agencies decide how to employ the frequency bands. In certain Middle Eastern countries, the VHF frequency band for U.S. TV channel 7 (174 - 180 MHz) is set aside for military communications. So, a wireless microphone in this frequency band that operates legally in the U.S. would not be warmly welcomed in any of these Middle Eastern countries. In Japan, all VHF wireless microphones are illegal.\n\nIn Europe, with the introduction of the mobile phone network based on LTE technology in the bands 790 -821 MHz and 832 - 862 MHz, these bands are no longer available for wireless microphones usage. Because of the reorganization of the UHF-TV band 470 - 862 MHz, the license regimes have changed as well. \n\nHow serious are the penalties?\n\nIn England, the fines can range up to $75,000. Imprisonment is a remote possibility, but the law does allow it. In Germany, a major concert event by a world renowned pop artist was shut down by the authorities five minutes before the show began. Over 10,000 attendees were sent home as the show was cancelled.  Confiscation of the illegal wireless equipment is a certainty.\n\nWhat can I do? My world tour starts next month!\n\nThe best solution is to rent (or purchase) a wireless system in each country that you perform. This relieves you of having to confirm that the wireless system is legal for the country. Plus if you have problems with the wireless, you have a local source for repair or replacement. Operating your U.S. wireless microphone system or wireless PSM in other countries is a decision only you can make, but Shure strongly recommends that you leave the wireless in the United States.\n\nThe Shure GLX-D system operates in the 2.4 GHz band.  This band is legal for wireless microphones in most countries.  However, before investing in the GLX-D, be certain to understand the pros and cons of 2.4 GHz operation."}, {"question": "Can I change a Shure 14H (high imp) to a 14L (low imp) by rewiring as per the included diagram sheet or are they totally different units?", "answer": "Answer\nBypass the output transformer of the 14H to make it a 14L.

So, we have no idea what connector is currently on your microphone.\n\nIf you want a 1/4 inch connector on it, the best solution is to cut off the old connector and solder on a new 1/4 inch connector. The BLACK cable goes to the tip of the 1/4 inch and the SHIELD goes to the sleeve of the 1/4 inch plug. The 520 is a high impedance model, so you do not need to change anything for a high impedance output."}, {"question": "Which mic is recommended for the violin? I usually play in live.

To prevent this from happening, turn down the transmitter input gain by adjusting the transmitter gain control. This is a screw driver adjustable control located in the battery compartment of the handheld; or located on one of the case sides of the body pack transmitter.\n\nThe gain control is properly set when the red peak LED on the receiver comes on only occasionally during peaks in the audio program.

The mic heads can be fastened together using two small pieces of self-adhering VELCRO.  DO NOT wrap the entire mic element with VELCRO as this will adversely affect the acoustical performance.\nIf you want the mics on either corner of the podium and the heads widely separated, connect the mics to the Shure SCM410 automatic mixer which will activate one or the other, depending on which mic is picking up the better signal.

I've heard both...", "answer": "Answer\nWhat does large diaphragm mean?\n\nSome individuals confidently (but arbitrarily) say a large diaphragm must have an inner diameter measuring one inch or more. Although, subjectively speaking, a one-inch diaphragm is relatively large; this benchmark has no basis in acoustical theory or practice. There is a more scientific method that helps give definition to what \u201clarge\u201d means. Scientifically, a diaphragm could be considered large if its diameter is as large as the wavelength of the highest frequency it is intended to reproduce. The wavelength of 20kHz is .678 inches under normal atmospheric and temperature conditions. Therefore by definition any diaphragm which measures .678 inches (approx. 11/16\u201d or 17mm) or greater is large.\n\nDoes the KSM32 have a large diaphragm?\n\nThe KSM32 has a large, .750 inch (3/4\u201d) diaphragm. Shure developed a diaphragm of this size to take advantage of its performance benefits over an even larger sized diaphragm. These include extended high frequency response, improved linearity and more consistent polar response at high frequencies. In addition, Shure\u2019s special embossing process has captured the salient benefit of some larger capsules -- a more highly compliant diaphragm that provides extended low frequency reproduction. By combining a .750\u201d diaphragm with embossing technology, the KSM32 is able to provide rich, smooth lows and balanced reproduction of any source without sacrificing clarity."}, {"question": "I play clarinet and tenor sax.

The nature of circuit design in oscillators makes this process too complex.\n\n\nOscillators can be thought of as unstable feedback systems. An unstable system is one in which an initially small excitation or disturbance produces an output that grows exponentially in time due to constructive, or positive, feedback. Typically, a relatively large feedback is necessary to get oscillation started in the first place - but once oscillation starts, the feedback must decrease so that the amplitude of the oscillation is limited at some finite value. The original large feedback is supplied by the battery. The feedback loop occurs at the emitter of the second BJT. BJT\u2019s were invented to be used as amplifiers. If these amplifiers are put in an unstable feedback system, they oscillate. In order for this oscillation to occur, the loop gain of the system must equal one. The condition for oscillation is intuitively satisfying since when the loop gain is 1, an excitation presented to the input of the circuit will appear back at the input after some delay (after traversing the feedback loop) with identical amplitude. This \u201cre-circulation\u201d of the disturbance would proceed indefinitely and the circuit \u201coscillates\u201d in a steady state - the fundamental period of the oscillation would be equal to the delay around the loop. This is what sets the frequency.\n\nIn most oscillators the loop gain is usually only equal to 1 at one particular frequency. At other frequencies, the amplitude may be less than or greater than 1, but the phase angle would be non-zero. This means that only one frequency component can travel around the loop with no phase shift. Only this frequency component will be amplified and grow to become a steady state oscillation. An initial disturbance is necessary in order for the oscillations to start - usually, the thermal noise voltage that is always present in electrical circuits is sufficient to start the oscillations. The feedback path is dependent on three lumped impedances Z1, Z2, Z3. Z1 contains C1, R1, C2, R2, and C3. Z2 contains Q2, R5, R4, C4, and the transformer. Z3 is R3. Even if we determined the correct value of these individual parts, the odds of the loop gain being 1 and the phase angle being 0 is about one in 10,000. So, in short, it can't be done easily.\n\nFor more information on the design of oscillators, please refer to the following books:\n\nCommunication Circuits: Analysis and Design, Kenneth K.

What can be causing this?", "answer": "Answer\nYou indicated that using another SM58 cures this problem, so we'll use that as part of the troubleshooting. Our initial guess is that the microphone is not being properly grounded. Either, pin 1 of the XLR is not connecting clear through to the shell of the microphone, or the grill is not making good metal to metal contact with the shell of the microphone.

The modification differs depending on which board revision you have. The board revision is printed in large capital letters on the upper right corner of the PC board. On any boards that start with a letter \u201cH\u201d or higher (e.g. HYRAX), there are holes labeled \u201cGroup Gate Jumper\u201d for each input channel.

Is a wireless mic more vulnerable to feedback than a wired mic?", "answer": "Answer\n\nWhen equalizing a system for feedback control, the object is to remove any peaks that are introduced from sound system components, room modes, etc. By using equalization, the gain of the system can usually be increased 3-6 dB. An automatic feedback reducer is an equalizer. The automatic feedback reducer is easier to operate because it will provide automatic notch filters to compensate for these peaks, but it does the same job as an equalizer in dealing with feedback. So, if you have the equalizers set up correctly to minimize feedback, then an automatic feedback eliminator probably would be redundant.\n\nIt is impossible to completely eliminate feedback whenever there is a live microphone and loudspeaker in the same room. You can always turn up louder, at which some point the system will feedback. The object is to get the sound loud enough to hear without feedback occurring.\n\nThere is no difference in the feedback characteristics of a wireless versus a wired microphone assuming the microphone element is the same.\n\nCheck out our online document on Basics of Equalization and Feedback."}, {"question": "Does Shure make a rectractable microphone hanger which might be mounted somewhere in a stagehouse to lower or retract depending upon the need for the mic?", "answer": "Answer\nShure does not, but the following companies do:\n\nServoreeler Systems\nXedit Corporation\n218-31 Ninety Seventh Avenue\nQueens Village, NY 11429\nservoreelers.com\nTel: (718) 464-9400\n\nDisplay Devices\n5880 N.

Its function is to convert acoustic sound waves into an equivalent electrical signal. This signal can then be recorded, transmitted, amplified, or modified. However, a microphone cannot effectively sort out desired \"noise\" (speech) from undesired background noise. Also, a microphone cannot improve the acoustic environment in which it is placed.\n\nWhat are acceptable speech to noise ratios?\n\nFundamental psycho-acoustic research states that intelligibility is a function of speech to background noise ratio.\nIf speech level is 0dB to 10dB above background noise level, intelligibility will be unacceptable to poor.\nIf speech level is 10dB to 20dB above background noise level, intelligibility will be poor to fair.\nIf speech level is 20dB to 30dB above background noise level, intelligibility will be fair to good.\nIf speech level is 30dB to 50dB above background noise level, intelligibility will be good to excellent.\nHow to predict if speech will be intelligible at the microphone location.\nAt the desired mic location, measure the Sound Pressure Level (SPL) A weighted. Make certain all background noise sources are operating, e.g. air conditioning, fluorescent lights, equipment cooling fans.\nExample: Background noise measures 46dB SPL A weighted\nMeasure the distance (in feet) from the farthest talker location to the mic location. Assuming that the talker produces 68dB SPL at 1 foot, use this formula: 68 - 20log(distance in feet). This provides the SPL of the talker at the mic location.\nExample: Farthest talker is 8 feet from microphone. Working out the formula gives:\nlog of 8 = 0.9\n0.9 x 20 = 18\n68 - 18 = 50dB SPL\nSubtract the background noise SPL from the talker SPL at the mic location. Compare the result with the speech to noise ratios listed above.\nExample: 50dB SPL(talker) - 46dB SPL (room noise) = 4dB This is unacceptable to poor intelligibility.\nWhat to do if the predicted intelligibility needs to be improved?\nMove the microphone closer to the talker. or...\nMake the room quieter via acoustical solutions. or...\nBoth of the above. or...\nAccept the predicted level of intelligibility\nTHERE ARE NO OTHER SOLUTIONS!\n\nImportant Note:\nThis bulletin does not address the intelligibility problems that can be caused by a reverberant room. Echoes and reflections from hard surfaces (glass, marble, hardwood floors, etc.) can ruin speech intelligibility even if the speech to background noise ratio is acceptable. Intelligibility problems caused by reverberation must be solved by adding acoustical treatment to the room or by moving the microphone closer to the talker."}, {"question": "I am a public school band/choir director.

I'm very happy with the sound when recording the piano. However, it seems to lose a lot of bass when I use it to record the violin. I noticed on the frequency response chart that the low frequency is lost when the mike is more than 3\" from the source. Unfortunately, I have to keep the mike a couple of feet from the violin, because the performer moves the violin too much. Since there's so much loss in bass, the violin sounds very thin when I record with the PGA81. It doesn't sound as rich as the real thing. Can you suggest a better microphone for recording the violin?", "answer": "Answer\nThe reduction in bass response you are experiencing is due to proximity effect. This effect is common to all unidirectional microphones (cardioid, supercardioid, etc.), and results in increased bass response as you get closer to the microphone. Consequently, as you increase distance from the microphone, you lose this additional bass response. Therefore, switching to another microphone that is positioned the same as the PGA81 will not cure this problem. The possible solutions are:\nMove the microphone closer to the sound source.\nAttach a miniature microphone to the instrument.

It needs to be able to pick up from a distance without feedback. What models do you recommend?", "answer": "Answer\nFeedback: Fact and Fiction\n\nOne of the most commonly asked questions in professional audio is \u201cWhat microphone can I use that doesn\u2019t cause feedback?\u201d The answer to the question is, of course, that no such microphone exists. Feedback results from a combination of many factors, including loudspeaker placement, microphone placement, the frequency response of both devices, and room acoustics.\n\nWhat is feedback?\n\nFeedback is characterized by a sustained, ringing tone, which can vary from a low rumble to a piercing screech. Echoes and reverberation caused by room acoustics, as well as ground buzz and other extraneous noises, are not the same thing as feedback, and cannot be cured in the same manner.\n\nWhat causes feedback?\n\nFeedback occurs whenever the sound entering a microphone is reproduced by a loudspeaker, picked up by the microphone, and re-amplified again and again. The familiar howl of feedback is an oscillation that is triggered by sound entering the microphone. The easiest way to create feedback is to point a microphone directly into a loudspeaker. (We don\u2019t recommend you try this!) Placing the microphone too close to the loudspeaker, too far from the sound source, or simply turning the microphone up too loud exacerbates feedback problems. Other contributing factors are too many open microphones, poor room acoustics, and uneven frequency response in either the microphones or loudspeakers.\n\nWhat can I do about feedback?\n\nThe single easiest way to reduce feedback is to move the microphone closer to the desired sound source. Additionally, using a directional microphone (cardioid, supercardioid, etc.) will typically increase the amount of gain before feedback. Reducing the number of open microphones with an automatic mixer will also improve the situation. Try to keep microphones and loudspeakers as far away from each other as possible. Lastly, acoustically treat the room to eliminate hard, reflective surfaces such as glass, marble, and wood.\n\nWhen all of the above solutions have been exhausted, the next step is to look towards equalizers and automatic feedback reducers. A common technique used by sound engineers is \u201cringing out\u201d a sound system by using a graphic equalizer to reduce the level of the frequencies that feedback first. After the techniques described in the above section have been applied, slowly bring up the system level until you begin to hear feedback. Now go to the equalizer and pull down the offending frequency roughly 3dB. If the feedback is a \u201choot\u201d or \u201chowl\u201d try cutting in the 250 to 500 Hz range. A \u201csinging\u201d tone may be around 1 kHz. \u201cWhistles\u201d and \u201cscreeches\u201d tend to be above 2 kHz. Very rarely does feedback occur below 80 Hz or above 8 kHz. It takes practice to develop an ear for equalizing a sound system, so be patient. After locating the first feedback frequency, begin turning up the system again until the next frequency begins ringing. Repeat the above steps until the desired level is reached, but do not over equalize. Keep in mind the equalizers can only provide a maximum level increase of 3 to 9 dB. Parametric equalizers, though more confusing to the novice user, allow for more precise control of feedback frequencies. A graphic EQ allows the user to cut fixed frequencies with a fixed filter width. A parametric EQ allows the user to isolate specific frequencies and adjust the width and depth of the filter.\n\nAutomatic feedback reducers will accomplish the same results as above. They find and cut the frequencies that are feeding back automatically. The same precautions listed above apply to feedback reducers as well as equalizers. Automatic feedback reducers are very helpful in wireless microphone applications. Remember that microphone placement is crucial to eliminating feedback, and the temptation to wander away from the ideal microphone position when using a wireless is great. If the performer gets too close to a loudspeaker, feedback will result; a good feedback reducer will be able to catch and eliminate the feedback faster than a human operator.\n\nProper implementation of the above techniques will go a long way towards eliminating feedback in your sound system. Do not rely solely on equalizers or feedback reducers, and remember that feedback results from more than just the microphone!\n\nDo not purchase any mic from any manufacturer without understanding the many, many causes of feedback. The microphone is only one part of the audio chain.\n\nWe recommend you call a reliable sound system installer in your area, have them visit your site, and make a recommendation of what steps to take.

Place the microphones at mouth height. Do not use stands that only lift the microphones 1-2 feet. This will cause comb filtering due to acoustic reflections off the stage floor.

If the performers are close to the microphones, then the stand mounted microphones would be beneficial. If the performers are further back, then the performance of the boundary microphone verses the stand mounted mic would be similar.\n\nWhen positioning the mics, adhere to the 3-to-1 rule. Details on this rule are in the publication listed below.\n\nOnly turn up the microphones that are near the performers on stage. Turn down (off) any unused microphones.

Can I use a rechargeable battery with my wireless mic?", "answer": "Answer\nBatteries and Wireless Microphones\n\nBenjamin Franklin first coined the term \"battery\" during his famous electrical experiments. Then around 1800, Alessandro Volta, a professor of natural philosophy at the University of Pavia, developed the first apparatus known to produce continuous electricity. Volta's name was later used to describe the potential of these cells: the volt.\nSince batteries are an expendable item, users are always trying to find cheaper, better alternatives. In the audio industry, wireless microphones are one of the top users of batteries. This article answers many of the common questions and explains how and why things operate the way they do.\n\nBattery Chemistry\nBatteries are devices that convert chemical energy into electrical energy. They are composed of cells. Cells are composed of a cathode and an anode immersed in an electrolyte. The different types of cells, such as alkaline, Nickel Cadmium (Ni-Cd), Nickel Metal Hydride (Ni-MH), all use these 3 components, but use different materials for the components. Batteries can be made up of a single cell or multiple cells.\n\nThe different battery types produce different voltages per cell, depending on their chemical reactions. For instance, an alkaline battery produces 1.5 volts per cell, and Ni-Cd batteries produce 1.2 volts per cell. For a AA or AAA battery, just a single cell is used per battery. For a 9 volt battery, 6 alkaline cells are used, wired in series.\n\nCells can be separated into two groups. Primary cells are one time use only, such as most alkalines and the old Zinc/Carbon type. Secondary cells are types that can be recharged, such as Ni-Cd, Ni-MH, and Lithium Ion (Li+). There are many more battery types, but this paper will only discuss the common ones applicable to wireless microphones.\n\nBattery Capacities\n\nThe most important specification for a battery is the capacity. The capacity is measured in mAh, i.e. current (specified in milli-amps) multiplied by time (specified in hours). If you know how much current a device takes to operate, it is possible to determine how long a battery will last.\nThe table below gives typical capacities of popular AA batteries.\nNon-Rechargeable Type mAh\nAlkaline 1200\nLithium 3000\n  Rechargeable Type mAh\nNi-Cd 600-1000\nNi-MH 1700-2500\nThe table below gives typical capacities of popular 9V batteries.\nNon-Rechargeable Type mAh\nAlkaline 500\nLithium 1200\nCarbon Zinc 300\n  Rechargeable Type mAh\nLi+ 500\nNi-Cd 120\nNi-MH 150\nNote: The capacity of alkaline batteries changes with current draw, thus you might see other sources with a different capacity for alkaline batteries. The capacity listed above is for the typical current draw of a wireless microphone transmitter.\nRechargeable Batteries\n\nMany people want to use rechargeable batteries with wireless systems. Rechargeable AA batteries tend to work quite well in wireless microphones.\n\nHowever, there are downsides to using certain types of rechargeable 9 volt batteries.\n\nThe first problem is the low capacity of Ni-Cd and Ni-MH 9 volt batteries. Ni-Cd and Ni-MH 9 volt batteries will last 1/4 of the time that an alkaline battery would. So, if your wireless bodypack lasts 8 hours with an alkaline battery, it would only last 2 hours with a Ni-Cd or Ni-MH 9 volt rechargeable battery.\n\nThe second problem is the voltage or rechargeable 9 volt batteries. Unfortunately, although batteries are packaged in the \"9 V\" size, they may not have a potential of 9 volts. Obviously, batteries that are the \"9 V\" size contain multiple cells. Since alkaline cells are 1.5 V, it takes 6 cells to make one 9 V battery. Six Ni-Cd cells (1.2 V per cell), though, are only 7.2 V. It is possible to get a \"9 V\" sized Ni-Cd with 7 or 8 cells to make 8.4 or 9.6 V respectively. This shows that when looking at batteries, attention must be paid to their actual voltage, not just their physical appearance. Wireless transmitters like to see 9 V, so the 7.2 V rechargeables are generally not acceptable. Also, the 9.6 volts of an 8 cell battery can be too much for a wireless transmitters.\n\nThe latest secondary cell is the rechargeable alkaline. The rechargeable alkaline is a good choice for a rechargeable battery. Unfortunately, no 9 volt version is available yet. While its initial capacity is within 10 percent of a standard alkaline, the discharge capacity fades with each cycle, with the majority of the fade occurring in early cycles.\n\nThe best choice for a rechargeable 9 volt battery is the Lithium Ion. This type or rechargeable battery has a similar capacity and discharge when compared to the alkaline.\n\nAA rechargeable batteries can often have a larger capacity than their alkaline equivalent, making them an excellent choice. The Lithium non-rechargeable AA battery will last about twice as long as an alkaline for those events that need extended battery time.\n\nCharging Rechargeable Batteries\n\nIf treated properly, secondary cells can be discharged and recharged hundreds of times and last many years. By far, the largest reason that rechargeable batteries fail to hold their charge is abuse. The largest cause of abuse is improper charging techniques. Books can and have been written about the charging techniques of secondary cells, so the information provided here will be an overview.\n\nMemory Effect\n\nFirst, the term \"memory effect\" needs to be addressed. Most people incorrectly use the term \"memory effect\". Memory effect is also synonymous with \"voltage depression.\" Memory effect is a temporary decrease in capacity. Note that it is temporary. The best explanation for voltage depression is from an article about Ni-Cd batteries by Ken Nishimura, University of California, Berkley.\n\nLet us define memory as the phenomenon where the discharge voltage for a given load is lower than it should be. This can give the appearance of a lowered capacity, while in reality, it is more accurate to term it voltage depression.\n\nOriginally, memory effect was seen in spacecraft batteries subjected to a repeated discharge/charge cycle that was a fixed percentage of total capacity (due to the earth's shadow). After many cycles, when called upon to provide the full capacity, the battery failed to do so.\n\nMemory can be attributed to changes in the negative or cadmium plate. Recall that charging involves converting Cd(OH) to Cd metal. Ordinarily, and under moderate charging currents, the cadmium that is deposited is microcrystalline (i.e. very small crystals). Now, metallurgical thermodynamics states that grain boundaries (boundaries between the crystals) are high energy regions, and given time, the tendency of metals is for the grains to coalesce and form larger crystals. This is bad for the battery since it makes the cadmium harder to dissolve during high current discharge, and leads to high internal resistance and voltage depression.\n\nThe trick to avoiding memory is avoiding forming large crystal cadmium. Very slow charging is bad, as slow growth aids large crystal growth. High temperatures are bad, since the nucleation and growth of crystals is exponentially driven by temperature. The problem is that given time, cadmium crystals will grow, and thus, the material needs to be reformed. Partial cycling of the cells means that the material deep within the plate never gets reformed. This leads to a growth of the crystals. By a proper execution of a discharge/charge cycle, the large crystal cadmium is destroyed and replaced with a microcrystalline form best for discharge.\n\nThis does not mean that the battery needs to be cycled each time it is used. This does more harm than good, and unless it is done on a per cell basis, the cells risk being reversed and that really kills them. Perhaps once in a while, use the pack until it is 90% discharged, or to a cell voltage of 1.0 V under light load. Here, about 95% of the cells capacity is used, and for all intents and purposes, is discharged. At this point, recharge it properly, and that's it.\n\nThe accompanying graph shows an experiment that Duracell performed on a Ni-MH cell. In cycle #1, the cell was discharged to 1.0 V then recharged. In cycles #2-#18, the cell was discharged to 1.15 V and then recharged. In the graph, it is apparent that cycle #18 had less capacity than cycles #1-#2. In cycles #19-#21, the cell was discharged completely to 1.0 V before recharging. The graph shows that after a couple full discharge/charge cycles, the cell returned to its normal capacity. This clearly shows that voltage depression is a temporary characteristic.\n\nCharging Techniques\nBasically, there are two charging techniques: constant voltage and constant current. Lead acid batteries use constant voltage sources. Ni-Cd and Ni-MH use constant current sources. Li Ion use constant current for most of the charge and then switch to constant voltage for the last period. Li Ion is by far the pickiest about its charging. This means that manufacturers must take more care when developing the batteries and chargers. Ironically, this makes the Li Ion batteries harder to abuse because the batteries and chargers are more intelligent. The main criteria for effective charging are choosing the appropriate rate, limiting the temperature, and selecting the appropriate termination technique. If a secondary cell does not last for hundreds of discharge-charge cycles and many years, it was most likely abused in charging. Overcharging is where the most damage is done to the battery.\n\nThere are many ways to determine when to stop charging a cell. Depending on the charge rate and type of battery, different termination techniques are used. Many times, multiple techniques are employed to guarantee proper charge termination. Common methods include (1) Timed Charge: charge the cell using low current over a set amount of time. (2) Voltage Drop: When a Ni-Cd cell is near full charge it rises sharply in voltage and then drops in voltage. The charging circuit detects this drop and stops the charge. (3) Voltage Plateau: Ni-MH does not have a very pronounced voltage drop, so instead the circuit detects the leveling off of the voltage upon full charge. (4) Temperature Cutoff: as the cell reaches full charge its temperature increases dramatically. The charging circuit terminates when the temperature of the cell reaches about 140F. (5) Delta Temperature Cutoff: measures the difference in temperature from start to end. The circuit would stop charging when the temperature is about 27F higher than the start temperature. This minimizes ambient temperature problems that the standard temperature cutoff exhibits. (6) Rate of Temperature Increase: measures how fast the temperature increases. If fast charging, the charger will stop when the rate of increase is about 1.8F per minute. This also helps minimize ambient temperature effects. Note that some of these termination methods are better for Ni-Cd cells and some are better for Ni-MH cells. For more information, see Duracell's paper on Ni-MH batteries available on their web site.\n\nThe life of a secondary cell can easily be up to 500 cycles. If a battery does not hold a charge after 50 or so cycles, it is not because of memory effect. It is because of a breakdown of some component of the battery, usually caused by abuse. Operation or storage at extreme temperatures, overcharging, cell venting and abusive use will reduce battery life. When a cell is overcharged excessively, exposed to extreme high temperatures, or otherwise abused, gas builds up in the cell. This excess pressure is released through a safety vent that is designed into the cell. Heat and overcharging are a rechargeable battery's worst enemies.\n\nBattery Physical Size\n\nBesides different voltages in batteries, batteries can also have different physical dimensions. This is true of both AA and 9 volt batteries. The dimensions of batteries can easily vary by over 1/16\". While that may not sound like much, 1/16\" can be a 13% change in the dimension of the battery. To the mechanical engineer that is designing the battery compartment, it makes a world of difference. Typically, the rechargeables are larger. There have been instances where battery compartments were too small to fit the larger batteries.\n\nBattery Discharge\n\nOf course every wireless transmitter will have a different battery life depending on the current draw of the circuit. There is one difference in circuit design, though, that can largely effect battery life: crystal controlled vs. frequency synthesized. Crystal controlled and frequency synthesized are the two circuit types that are used to create an RF frequency\n\nCrystal controlled\n\nThe circuit design for a crystal controlled system is fairly simple and uses a minimum amount of components. This design is fairly efficient in operation so battery life can be quite long. The disadvantage to this method is that the system is limited to a single frequency.\n\nFrequency Synthesized\n\nFrequency synthesis circuits can produce many frequencies from a single reference crystal, allowing for multiple operating frequencies. Since the frequency synthesis circuit is more complex, the components used draw more current and therefore shorten the battery life of the transmitter.\n\nAs electrical component manufacturers develop more efficient components, the battery life of these two circuit designs will grow closer together. The graph shows a crystal controlled UT transmitter versus a frequency synthesized UC system, both 9 volt powered transmitters.\n\nWhich Battery to Use\n\nMany times the Applications Engineering Department at Shure is asked for battery recommendations. The accompanying graph of a UT transmitter helps summarize the performance of different 9 volt batteries with wireless microphones.\n\nThe first battery on the graph is an alkaline type. The 9 volt alkaline battery is the best battery for the job. It provides very good performance time along with decent voltage levels for a minimal amount of money. Alkaline batteries are the recommended choice for nearly all wireless systems and applications. There are other batteries, such as Lithium, that will last longer, but cost much more.\n\nThe second battery on the graph is an 8.4 volt version of a Ni-MH battery. During its usable life, the voltage of the 8.4 battery tracks the alkaline quite well. An 8.4 volt version of a Ni-Cd would die out about 10-30 minutes before the Ni-MH did.\n\nThe third battery shown is a 7.2 volt version of the Ni-Cd. Whether Ni-Cd or Ni-MH, 7.2 volt batteries do not have adequate performance to provide the proper voltage for the wireless transmitter. Batteries that are only 7.2 volt are not recommended for wireless systems.\n\nConclusion\n\nBy knowing the current draw of the wireless transmitter along with the capacity of the battery, it is possible to know the life of the battery. Wireless transmitters that use AA batteries, rechargeables and alkalines both perform well. For older transmitters that use 9 volt batteries, it is easy to show that rechargeable 9 volt Ni-Cd and Ni-MH batteries have a much shorter life than standard alkaline types. For this reason, 9 volt Ni-Cd and Ni-MH rechargeables are typically not well suited for wireless transmitter applications. Therefore, 9 volt alkaline batteries are the best choice because of their performance for the cost. If an application does require rechargeable batteries, use the 9 volt version of the rechargeable Li+ batteries.\n\nUntil someone finishes Nikola Tesla's experiments on wireless electricity, batteries will be a major part of our lives. Learning how to properly choose and use these batteries will make the experience as pleasant as possible.\nCommon alkaline batteries are Duracell, Energizer, etc.\n\nMost drug store brand batteries are zinc-carbon.

Allocation and regulation of radio frequencies is supervised by specific government agencies in each country with the result that allowable (legal) frequencies and frequency bands differ from country to country. In addition to frequency, these government agencies typically specify other aspects of the equipment itself, including transmitter power, modulation type, spurious emissions, and other parameters. These specifications differ from one band to another and from one user to another within a given band. For these reasons, it is not possible to select a specific frequency or frequency band that is legally usable in all parts of the world.\n\nUse of the radio frequency bands in the United States is regulated by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC). Certain frequencies within each band have been designated for use by wireless microphones as well as by other services. In the United States, the frequencies used for these systems may be grouped into general bands or ranges:\nLow-band VHF (49-108 MHz)\nHigh-band VHF (174-216 MHz)\nLow-band UHF (450-616 MHz)\n900 MHz (902-928 MHz and 940-960 MHz)\nUPCS/DECT (1920-1930 MHz)\n2.4 GHz (2400-2480 MHz)\n5 GHz (5000-6000 MHz)\n\nThe FCC also determines who can operate in each band and who has priority if more than one user is operating. Primary users include licensed radio/television broadcasters and commercial communications services such as 2-way radio, pagers, and mobile phones. Wireless microphone system users are always considered to be secondary users. In general, priority is given to primary users. Secondary users may not interfere with primary users, but secondary users may be subject to interference from primary users.\n\nPlease note that while manufacturers must be licensed by the FCC to sell wireless equipment, it is the responsibility of the wireless microphone system operator to observe FCC regulations regarding its actual use.\n\nDescribed below are the VHF and UHF radio frequency bands. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages for wireless microphone operation, based on the designated users of the band, the physical characteristics of the band, and the regulatory limitations of the band.\n\nVHF\n\nAt the beginning of the low-band VHF range is the 49 MHz region. This region is used not only by inexpensive wireless microphones, but also by some cordless telephones, walkie-talkies, and radio controlled toys. The 54-72 MHz region is occupied by VHF television channels 2 - 4. The 72 MHz area is used by \"assistive listening\" type wireless systems. 76 - 88 MHz are assigned to VHF television channels 5 and 6. At the top of the low band VHF range, 88 - 108 MHz is the commercial FM radio broadcast band. All of these regions have been used at one time or another for wireless microphone systems. Allowable deviation limits (typically up to 15kHz) can accommodate high-fidelity audio. This is the same deviation as for FM radio broadcast. The propagation of these RF waves through the air is very good, as is their ability to pass through many non-metallic substances. This is a result of the relatively long wavelength which ranges from 9 feet to 20 feet. The most attractive feature of operation in the low-band VHF range is low equipment cost.\n\nExcept for assistive listening systems, low-band VHF is not recommended for serious applications. Due to the large number of primary and secondary users, plus high levels of general radio frequency (RF) \"noise,\" this band is prone to interference from many sources. Transmitter power is limited to less than 50 mW, except in the 72-76 MHz range where up to 1 watt is allowed for assistive listening systems. Finally, the minimum proper antenna size for units in this range can be over three feet long (1/4 wavelength), which can severely limit portability and/or efficiency.\n\nThe high-band VHF range is used for professional audio applications, and quality wireless microphone systems are available for sale. In the U.S., the high-band VHF range is 174 - 216 MHz. The primary users of this band are VHF television channels 7 - 13. Each occupies 6 MHz of bandwidth: channel 7 (174 - 180 MHz); channel 8 (180 - 186 MHz), etc. High quality audio is possible using digital modulation, and 1/4 wavelength antenna sizes range down to less than 14 inches.\nThe possibility of interference from other secondary users and general RF noise exists, especially from Ethernet networks which operate up to approximately 350 MHz. In addition, this range includes the primary users of television channels 7 - 13. In some other countries, the high-band VHF range extends to 230 MHz. This band is generally not recommended for new wireless microphone installations, except in specific circumstances. Contact Shure Applications Engineering for more information on when to specify VHF systems.\n\nUHF\n\nLike the VHF region, the UHF region contains several bands that are used for wireless microphone systems. However, certain physical, regulatory, and economic differences between VHF and UHF regions should be noted here. The primary physical characteristic of UHF radio waves is their much shorter wavelength of 12 inches to 24 inches. The most apparent consequence of this is the much shorter length of antennas for UHF wireless microphone systems. One less obvious consequence is slightly reduced radio wave propagation both through the air and through other non-metallic materials, such as walls and human bodies. However, more efficient antenna designs usually overcome this issue. Another consequence is the increased amount of radio wave reflections by smaller metal objects, resulting in comparatively more frequent and more severe interference due to multi-path (dropouts). However, diversity receivers are very effective in the UHF band and the required antenna spacing is minimal.\n\nWhile the regulations for users and for licensing are essentially the same in the VHF and UHF bands, regulations for the equipment allow two potential differences. For FM signals in the UHF band, greater occupied bandwidth is allowed. This effectively permits greater deviation for potentially wider frequency range and wider dynamic range of the audio signal. In addition, transmitter power up to 250 mW is allowed. Finally, the available radio spectrum for UHF wireless microphone system use is significantly larger than for high-band VHF. This allows for a much larger number of wireless microphone systems to be operated simultaneously. The capability for an increased number of simultaneous systems is a significant benefit.\nThe low-band UHF range of frequencies may be considered as two overlapping bands: low (450-536 MHz) and high (470-616 MHz). The primary users of these bands are business services such as land mobile radio and pagers (450-536 MHz), and UHF television channels 14 - 36 (470-608 MHz). Above 608 MHz, there exists a 6 MHz Radio Astronomy observation band, and then a 2 MHz wide guard band before the 600 MHz cellular bands begin at 616 MHz. As in the high-band VHF region, unused television channels are allotted for wireless microphone system use. Business and television are the primary users in the low part of this band, but interference from primary users is rare in the high (non-business) part of the band aside from UHF television stations. Other secondary users and RF noise are also less likely at these frequencies than at VHF.\n\nThe required minimum 1/4 wavelength antenna size for UHF radio waves is 4 - 7 inches. Equipment is reasonably priced, diversity systems are standard to minimize dropouts, and high quality audio can be achieved along with a large number of simultaneous systems.\n\nThe high-band UHF range, above 900 MHz, includes both the license-free ISM band from 902-298 MHz, and licensed studio-to-transmitter link (STL) band from 940-960 MHz. The ISM band is useful for small channel count systems, and may be used nationwide\u2014but interference from smart utility meters may limit the usefulness of this band. The STL band offers additional channels and potentially less interference from RF noise, as well as antenna lengths of only 3 or 4 inches, but a license is required for all users. Other operating characteristics are similar to low-band UHF. It should be noted that the allocation of these bands is always subject to governmental change as demand for spectrum increases.\nThis, along with other information about how wireless microphones work, can be found in our online publication Selection and Operation of Wireless Microphone Systems."}, {"question": "I was thinking about switching the head on my wireless from an SM58 to a Beta 87A.

This is done to be able to handle electret microphones with mono jacks (no separate tip and ring). I have seen some Taiwan PC motherboard companies do this. What happens if a dynamic microphone is used on this jack and the bias current flows through the MIC voice coil? Does it affect the microphone performance? Or, because the bias is a DC current it has no effect? I realize that a dynamic mic is less sensitive and will require an internal preamp (and the signal will face the 2K impedance of the mic bias resistor), but will it still produce it's normal AC audio signal into the jack with the bias current present?\nWhat is the typical output impedance of an electret microphone (at the tip, AC wise)?\nFollow up questions\n\nThanks for your quick response. You do raise some interesting points.\nThe bias current under the conditions that I described is about 1 to 3 mA, will this be enough to damage or upset the dynamic microphone?\nDo the professional dynamic microphones actually have a built-in preamp? Are they powered by batteries?", "answer": "Answer\n  It does effect the microphone and could damage the microphone. The bias voltage should be blocked by a capacitor. It will still produce an AC audio signal with the bias present, assuming the current from the bias doesn't burn up and destroy the voice coil. It could very well sound funny though. With DC current running through the coil, the coil will no longer be centered in the magnetic field.\nIt depends on where you are measuring it. Directly off the element, the impedance is usually in the megaohm range. Within one inch of the element, there will be a JFET. The output of the JFET has an impedance of 1-2kohm. A professional microphone will then have a another set of electronics that lower the impedance even further to 150-300 ohms.\nWe do not have the specifications on how much current would heat up the voice coil enough to fry it. \nNo. Professional dynamic microphones do not have a built-in preamp."}, {"question": "Would splitting the output of a wireless receiver (in Mic output mode) to two independent mixers give me any problems like a crackling, overdriven noise on one of the systems?", "answer": "Answer\nNo, there shouldn't be any problem with the splitting the audio output of a wireless receiver to 2 different mixers."}, {"question": "I am involved with a theatre group that is planning to do a production of 42nd Street. We were wondering if there are microphones or accessories that could be used to reinforce the sound of the tap dancing. Are there floor microphones that accomplish this?", "answer": "Answer\nProductions like \"Stomp\" attach a small mic near the feet of the dancer. Each dancer wears a wireless transmitter to send the mic signal to the sound booth. With this expensive setup, the mic moves with the performer and so the tap sound is always consistent.\n\nExample of Shure product for this approach: ULX-D & DL4\n\nThey also prerecord the sound of the \"tap\", to be played back in synch with the music during the performance. Essentially, this is the equivalent of lip synching.\n\nPlacing stationary mics, like the Shure MX391, at the front of the stage is much less expensive.

The higher quality Shure KSM141 condenser mic has a limit of 164 dB SPL!\n\nA dynamic mic has no electronics and its SPL limit is a physical limitation: the point where the diaphragm hits the magnet and can move no further.

If so, it is very likely a high impedance input.\n\nThe SM58 is a low impedance microphone. All professional mics are low impedance.\n\nPlacing a low impedance to high impedance transformer at the equipment end of the mic cable is the best solution. The transformer steps up the SM58 signal output to satisfy the high impedance input of the Peavey. Consider the Shure A85F or A95UF transformer.\n\nWe do not recommend exchanging the SM58 for a high impedance mic. In general, high impedance mics are of lesser quality than low impedance mics.

I usually set up the volume of my receiver at 12 o\u00b4clock (or 5 volume level) and let the monitor engineer bring the different sound sources up during soundcheck (drums, bass, guitars, keys and vocals) until they are at a comfortable listening level. An outside engineer recommended i set up my receiver level at around 2 o\u00b4clock (7 volume level) to avoid having the signals on the monitor board become \"too hot\", and thus prevent any sort of distortion in my ear monitors. What volume level on my receiver should i aim for? 5? 7? 10??? I had originally decided to set it up at 5 to have a clear visual reference in order to turn it down (in case the overall volume of the band is too high) or turn it up (in case the overall volume of the band is too low). What's best?", "answer": "Answer\nActually, there are a couple things you can do to prevent distortion, which are unrelated to the setting of your volume control.\nIf the monitor engineer sends a signal that it too \"hot\" to your P6HW, the input will distort before the earphones do. If you begin to hear distortion because of the monitor send, open up the battery compartment and flip switch number 1 into the \"Up\" position. This will engage a 15 dB pad at the input. This should be enough attenuation to prevent the monitor signal from causing distortion. You will probably need to increase the volume control to compensate for the reduced input signal.\nMake sure the limiter is turned on (switch 4). The limiter will prevent excessively loud sounds from damaging your ear drums. Chances are, you would be damaging your hearing long before you could pump enough signal into the E5 to cause distortion. The limiter not only protects your hearing, but should prevent the output stage of the P6HW from distorting the E5s.\n\nRemember that increasing the volume control of the P6HW does not increase headroom, it only increases background noise. Additionally, if the signal is distorting at the input of the P6HW, putting the volume control at 2 o'clock will only make the distortion louder - use the input pad."}, {"question": "Why does a balance line provide a better quality sound?", "answer": "Answer\nThe balanced line does not provide better audio quality.

The tracking force range is 0.75 to 1.5 grams."}, {"question": "What are explanations of stylus shapes and terms?", "answer": "Answer\nSpherical Stylus\n\nThe typical Shure spherical stylus tip has a radius of 0.7 mil.\nPositive attribute: less tip wear due to a larger surface area contacting the record.\nNegative attribute: high frequency response will be rolled-off as the \"large\" radius of the tip will not trace the \"small\" grooves containing the highest frequencies.\n\nBiradial Stylus\n\nThe typical Shure biradial stylus tip has radii of 0.4 x 0.7 mil or 0.2 x 0.7 mil.\n\nNote: The term \"biradial\" describes the stylus tip shape more accurately than the more commonly used term \"elliptical\".\nPositive attribute: better high frequency response than a spherical due to the smaller contact radii of the stylus tip.\nNegative attribute: slightly faster tip wear than a spherical due to the decreased tip/groove contact area.\n\nElliptical Stylus\n\nSee Biradial above.\n\nHyperelliptical Stylus\nPositive attribute: longer tip life than a biradial.\nNegative attribute: difficult to manufacture and therefore expensive.\n\nIf a cartridge requires a hyperelliptical stylus tip (a tip shape no longer offered by Shure), substitute a biradial stylus with 0.2 x 0.7 mil tip.\n\nMicro-Ridge\n\nThe Micro-Ridge is the most advanced tip shape available. It is based on a hyperelliptical design but has additional shaping to the tip to create the \"Micro-Ridge\".\nPositive attribute: lowest tip wear of any tip shape AND the best high frequency response.\nNegative attribute: very difficult to manufacture and therefore very expensive.\n\nStylus for 78 RPM records\n\nThe groove of a 78 RPM record is much wider than the groove of a 33 1/3 RPM record, so a larger stylus tip is required. The tip radius should be 2.0 mils or larger. The tip shape should be spherical.\nIf a 0.7 mil spherical stylus tip is employed, it will ride very low in the groove and may even ride on the bottom of the groove.

The needle gets stuck at the end of some records usually right before the run-out grove in the last minute or 2 of music or in the run-out groove itself. It seems to happen when playing an LP from the start (most 7\" singles play all the way through - even the run-out groove). If it sticks and I replay just the last song, it seems to play through - it only seems to happen when the record is played all the way from the start. I am not using this to DJ - just playing records all the way through. I have read on your site that the tracking force should be set to 3 grams but that is twice the max in the specs - is that right? I have played with the arm height, anti-skate (from zero to 2 grams) - I have mounted the cartridge all the way back in the headshell and that seemed to help a bit. Any thoughts? I called Numark and they said increase the tracking force to 3 Grams and raise the arm height and set the anti-skate to zero - that did not solve it. I have mounted the cartridge 'by eye' do you guys make a tool to make sure it is mounted correctly?", "answer": "Answer\n\nIt is likely that the tone arm is sticking. The stylus is a passive device; its movement is controlled completely by the record groove. But the tone arm must not bind at any point; if it does bind, it will tend to cause the stylus to skip back to a previous groove.\n\nWe cannot think of a scenario where the stylus would cause a skip at just one part of a record. But your problem does fit the scenario of a tone arm bearing that binds when the arm is near the center of a record. We suggest you speak with a tone arm engineer at Numark to discuss possible binding of the tone arm bearings.\n\nFor non-DJ work, the 3 grams of tracking force is too heavy. Set it to 1.5 grams and set the anti-skate to 1.5 grams. The M44G should work just fine IF the tone arm is not binding."}, {"question": "Just bought Shure SM58 mics over the internet.

The karaoke player has the single female connection where the mic has the three prong. I purchased an adapter (HOSA GXP143 XLR - 1/2\" m - not a transformer) and when we plugged the mic in we picked up a radio station. Should I have used a different adaptor, or is there some way I can alleviate this problem?", "answer": "Answer\nThe unscientific approach is to buy a Shure A85F transformer (or equivalent) and see if that solves the problem.\n\nThe scientific approach is to get technical details about the karaoke player's mic input. Then send that information to Shure and receive our suggestions.\n\nThe following lists the information we require:\n\nWhat specifications determine if a Shure microphone will properly operate with your camcorder or your tape recorder or your karaoke player or your computer sound card or your anything!\n\nShure is often asked \"Will microphone model X work with my \u2026\u2026.?\" While we would love to have the microphone input specifications of each and every device in the world that needs a microphone, it is an impossible task. So for us to help you select the proper microphone, we need you to provide the following three vital specifications for the microphone input of your device. Typically, these specifications will be provided in the Owner's Manual for your device or you may have to call the manufacturer of the device.\n\nVITAL MICROPHONE INPUT SPECIFICATION #1\n\nTypically called \"Input Sensitivity\" or \"Nominal Input Level\", this specification indicates how large of a signal the microphone must supply to satisfy the microphone input of your device. This specification might be given in millivolts (mV), or volts (V), or in a minus dB form (-dBV, -dBm, -dBu, -dBs).\n\nIn the Shure product line, there is a wide variation of signal levels available depending on the microphone model. If you select a microphone whose signal level is too low for your device, the audio will be noisy and low in level. If you select a microphone whose signal level is too great for your device, the audio will be distorted and unintelligible. Proper matching of the microphone's signal level to your device's required input level is imperative.\n\nVITAL MICROPHONE INPUT SPECIFICATION #2\n\nTypically called \"Input Impedance\" or \"Actual Input Impedance\", this specification is important as it will determine the proper impedance range of the chosen microphone. This specification will be given in ohms. Contrary to popular audio mythology, the impedance of a microphone does not need to match the input impedance of your device.\n\nIn the Shure product line, there are multiple impedances available depending on the microphone model. If you select a microphone whose impedance is lower than or equal to your device's input impedance, the microphone will work if it provides the proper signal level (see #1 above). If you select a microphone whose impedance is greater than your device's input impedance, the microphone will not deliver its full signal level to your device and the audio will be noisy and low in level.\n\nVITAL MICROPHONE INPUT SPECIFICATION #3\n\nThis final specification is the type of microphone input connector on your device, how many connection points are in the connector, and what is the function of each connection point. This specification will be the name of the connector, such as: XLR female, 3.5mm mini-phone plug, TRS 1/4\" female phone jack, screw terminals, TINI QG connector. Each of these has at least two connection points and most have three (or more) connection points. It is imperative that the function of each connection point be known so that the proper microphone wiring can be determined.\n\nIn the Shure product line, there are many wiring schemes available depending on the microphone model. If the microphone connections are not properly matched to your device's input connector, there may be no audio, or funny sounding audio, or the microphone might be damaged if there is an unknown voltage appearing on your device's connection points.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAs you can see, there are many variables that affect whether a particular microphone will work with your device. Shure will be happy to assist in your microphone selection, but to do the job correctly, we need you to provide the pieces of this technical puzzle that Shure does not have: the audio input specifications of your device."}, {"question": "How do I make a wireless boundary microphone using the MX391?", "answer": "Answer\nBuilding a Wireless Desktop Microphone Using the MX391\n\nProcedure\nPrepare the MX391 to connect to a Shure bodypack wireless transmitter.\nUnplug the microphone from its in-line preamplifier tube.  Set the tube aside, as it is not needed for the wireless application.  However, the preamplifier tube can be used later should the MX391 be needed in a wired configuration. \nCut the factory installed TA4F connector from the cable.  If needed, trim the microphone cable to the desired length.\nInstall a new TA4F connector.  The connector can be obtained from most electronics suppliers (Switchcraft TA4F) or from the Shure parts department (part number WA330).  The Shield (ground) must be connected to both Pin 1 and the metal body of the connector.  To connect to the body, solder a short jumper wire from pin 1 to the connector's internal metal cable grip.  The Red wire (bias voltage) connects to Pin 2, and the Black wire (audio) connects to both Pin 3 and Pin 4.\nNote: If the Shure transmitter body pack is metal (and not plastic), a new TA4F connector does NOT need to be installed.\n\nParts Needed\n1 MX391 boundary microphone\n1 Shure wireless system with bodypack transmitter (almost all Shure bodypacks use the TA4F connector). \n1 Switchcraft (or equivalent) TA4F Connector (available as Shure #WA330).\n\n\n "}, {"question": "I have an old Soundesign stereo system.

We need a lavalier because our minister keeps hitting the boom mounted mic with his hands and I can not get him to keep it close enough to his mouth. He does not feel comfortable with it closer than two feet. I also am having a lot of trouble with picking up traffic noise as the building is close to a road. In addition, our minister sits in a chair and the mic is picking up the sound of his sleeve buttons and arms hitting the chair arms so I get a clicking noise along with thumps on the recordings. I use a Peavey 12 channel mixer and do have phantom power available. What mic would work best to reject all extraneous noise?", "answer": "Answer\nOf our lavalier microphones, the MX184 (supercardioid) has the most rejection of ambient noise. Whether it will reject everything you want it to, we don't know. Unfortunately, a microphone cannot tell the difference between your ministers voice, the traffic, or the click of buttons, so it will pick up anything it hears.\n\nWe suggest you try the MX184 and also try the R185B (cardioid element) on the MX184 body.

I'm guessing their perception of bass is actually lower mids but I can't find any frequency graphs on your site to confirm this. I would have expected the SM57 to sound bassier because a greater proximity effect is possible since you can get closer to the cartridge but I guess many people's sense of bass is not really low frequency extension.", "answer": "Answer\nThe SM58 and the SM57 share the same mic element, the Unidyne III. The only difference between the these two models is the grill design.\n\nThe grill design does affect the high frequency response, particularly above 8,000 Hz.\n\nThe SM57 grill design allows more proximity effect because the mic diaphragm can be placed closer to the sound source. Proximity effect increases each time the distance from the mic to the source is halved. When a mic is placed very close, it is quite easy to halve the distance: 1 inch to 1/2 inch; 1/2 inch to 1/4 inch; etc. Remove the ball grill from the SM58 and it will be more similar to the SM57 in its low frequency response.\n\nAny other differences you hear between the SM57 and SM58 are likely to be subjective (psycho-acoustic) or due to slight manufacturing differences due to part tolerance.\n\nWhy does Proximity Effect Occur?"}, {"question": "I am installing a focus group room, i.e. a place where several people meet around a table and talk about a particular topic leaded by a trained specialist.

Shure is not responsible for damage caused to a Sennheiser microphone if this circuit proves incorrect.\n\nThere are two methods to wire a Sennheiser MKE2 to a Shure bodypack.\n\nMethod 1: -R and -P style models\n\nTo make this modification it is necessary to remove the connector or preamp attached to the microphone cable. This will require disassembling the connector or preamp and unsoldering the attached cable or simply cutting off the cable at the strain relief. Once this is accomplished, the following color codes configuration can be applied to equip the exposed cable with a Switchcraft TA4F connector for mating with the Shure wireless transmitter.\nMic ---> Transmitter\nRed Wire ---> Pin 2\nBlue Wire ---> Pin 3 and Pin 4\nShield ---> Pin 1\n\nMethod 2: -3, -2, -5, -2R, & -4, all MKE2 GOLD Models\n\nPer Sennheiser's Service Department (860-434-9190 ext. 151) any Sennheiser MKE2 microphone that is factory supplied without a connector (pigtailed cable) can be connected to a Shure transmitter using the following diagram. This wiring scheme provides an output level that is 10 to 14 dB greater than the typical wiring scheme.\n\nNote: This circuit may not work if the MKE2 is supplied with a connector by Sennheiser. MKE2 units with factory supplied connectors may be wired differently within the capsule.\n\nThe following color codes configuration can be applied to equip the pigtailed cable with a Switchcraft TA4F connector for mating with the Shure wireless transmitter.\n\nR1 = 8.2k Ohms, 1/8 Watt\nThe resistor should fit inside of the TA4F.\nThe jumper is required between Pin 3 and Pin 4 to set the correct input impedance (20k ohms).\nAttention\n\nIf there is no short circuit between the blue wire and shield, please use the first pin configuration, otherwise the second.\n\nThere are -3 models which will not work properly with the second pin configuration also. This depends upon the original mic condition, with or without Sennheiser connector.\n\nMKE2 Gold models will work in either configuration with any body pack and with the RK100PK but not with the RPM626. To get them to work with a RPM626 use the second configuration.\n\nConnector\n\nThe mating connector for the Shure wireless transmitters is a Switchcraft TA4F, available as part number WA330.\n\nThe connector can also be purchased from Mouser Electronics at 800-346-6873.\n\n\nTA4M\nTransmitter View\nPIN 1 = cable shield / audio return / bias return\nPIN 2 = +5V DC Bias\nPIN 3 = audio input for dynamic mics or instruments\nPIN 4 = 20K Ohms resistor to ground jumpered to pin 3 for condenser mics"}, {"question": "What is the complete length of the MX412D/C desktop gooseneck mic including the base assembly ?

Low impedance microphones, like the SM58 have a very low output level. A guitar, on the other hand, has a much hotter output. The sound card on your computer requires a hotter level.\n\nComputer has a USB port.\n\nTo connect a professional microphone to a computer, you will need to bypass the computer sound card and use a USB interface, such as the Shure MVi or X2u USB Adapter. These are high quality microphone preamps with a USB computer interface. They are an outboard audio interface. That is, you would no longer use the sound card that came in your computer. They do supply phantom power for condenser microphones. You can also purchase a microphone, such as the Shure MV5 or MV51, that have built-in USB ports.\n\nComputer does not have a USB port.\n\nIf you do not have a USB port on your computer, you can try one of the following solutions. The MVi and X2u USB adapters will work better than the following solutions.\n\nThe first non-USB possibility is to interface a professional microphone with a computer soundcard through the use of a microphone preamp.\n\nThe second non-USB possibility is to use a transformer, such as the Shure A96F, to help boost the level of your SM58 to something that would likely be appropriate for the sound card. The A96F has a female XLR on one end and an 1/8\" connector on the other end. Place the transformer at the computer and use a standard XLR cable between it and your SM58. The transformer will be less expensive than the microphone preamp, but it may not provide enough gain for your particular sound card. The A96F will not work with a phantom powered condenser microphone."}, {"question": "I am using a ULX-D in the X52 band (900 MHz band). Occasionally, I encounter interference but it does not happen all the time. How can I avoid this interference?", "answer": "Answer\nIn the United States, the ULXD-X52 operates in the 902 to 928 MHz band.  Though this band is not used for broadcast TV, the 902 to 928 MHz band is used for other non-licensed wireless devices; the band is not reserved only for wireless microphones.  These other devices can be industrial, scientific, security, educational, or medical, and they have the same rights to operate in this frequency band as the wireless microphones. No device has priority over another device.\n\nHere are examples of identified devices known to operate in this band:\nWireless network that reports a power outage to the local electric company.  This device was located on a utility pole outside of a church.  The device used \"frequency-hopping\" and can occasionally \"hop\" directly onto a ULXD operating frequency.\nA security system in a television studio.  This device emitted bursts of RF energy in the 900 MHz band.\nA commercial phone system, made in the early 1990s, in a church. Every 15 minutes, this phone control center would emit a very strong (almost one watt!), 900 MHz band signal that queried the wireless phones: \"Are you on?\"  \"What frequency are you using?\" This RF burst from the phone system produced one second of audible interference in a 900 MHz wireless mic system.\nA \"timing mat\" used at high school and college wrestling matches.\nA Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) system used for running races.  Each runner has a unique RFID tag.  As the runner crosses over an antenna placed on the ground, the exact time of the crossing is logged.\nSources of ULXD-X52 interference would typically be nearby.  When seeking the source of interference, look for devices with antennas which are within 200 feet of the ULXD receiver.\n\nWith the examples given above, there are two possible solutions:\nReplace the ULXD-X52 system with a system that operates in the UHF TV band, or\nPower off (or replace) the device causing the interference\nA simple test to determine if the problem is local interference is to operate the ULXD in a different environment, at least one mile away from the venue.  If the root cause is local interference, the ULXD will work fine in a different environment. If the ULXD needs repair, it will work poorly no matter where it is used.  A more accurate test is for a local wireless microphone expert to employ an RF spectrum analyzer.  The analyzer can display the frequency and strength of the signal causing the interference.\n\nHere is the original announcement from Shure about the ULX-D X52 band - dated August 2015:\n\nShure announced that its renowned ULX-D\u00ae Digital Wireless Systems are now available in the 900 MHz ISM frequency band. Targeted for use where UHF \"TV band\" spectrum is limited or congested, ULX-D 900 MHz features components and accessories optimized for use within regional variations of the 902-928 MHz spectrum, generally known as the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band.\n\nWith the introduction of industry-leading ULX-D Digital Wireless Systems capable of operating in the unlicensed 900 MHz band, customers can experience high-quality digital wireless audio in an alternative band, free of the regulatory issues wireless microphone users currently face, or may eventually face, in the heavily-saturated UHF TV band.\n\n\"Shure has been at the forefront of spectrum topics, serving as a source for the latest information about the UHF TV Band Incentive Auction, explaining the impact for wireless microphone users, and advocating on behalf of the industry,\" said Nick Wood, Category Director for Wireless Products at Shure. \"As awareness of the upcoming spectrum change increases, we continue to research and develop solutions for wireless microphone users.  We saw the opportunity to adapt the digital technology of our ULX-D systems to the specific requirements of the 900 MHz ISM band while keeping the same great performance and feature sets that have made these systems successful.\"\n\nAs part of its ongoing commitment to support wireless microphone users with superior wireless solutions for an ever-evolving spectrum landscape, Shure has conducted extensive scanning, site surveys, and product testing in the 900MHz ISM spectrum.  The new ULX-D option performs to the same high standards of that system when the application and the RF environment are a good fit. The 900 MHz ISM band may also be used by devices such as wireless internet access points, security systems, smart meters, Bluetooth devices, two-way radios, and intercoms. Because many of these services transmit in short bursts across multiple frequencies, this RF environment can be less predictable than the TV band has typically been. For this reason, Shure has announced that the latest version of its Wireless Workbench\u00ae 6 software (version WWB 6.11.2) will feature a new Site Survey tool that enables customers to assess the availability of 900MHz ISM spectrum in a particular venue. The Site Survey Tool uses the receiver to capture a long-term scan and processes the data to provide a Usability Report, indicating an approximate number of usable channels in the ISM band.\n\nIn general, ULX-D 900 MHz systems are best suited for indoor use, where the environment can be assessed before the systems are installed. Usage outside of these applications is certainly an option, but Shure recommends consulting with an authorized retailer if there is any question about which band is the best fit when purchasing ULX-D Digital Wireless Systems.\n\nIn the U.S., the ULX-D 900 MHz system can support up to 12 compatible channels per frequency band, or up to 73 channels in high density mode."}, {"question": "What are the various earphone and headphone specifications?", "answer": "Answer\nUnderstanding Earphone/Headphone Specifications\n\nThough one of the most common items in the audio chain, earphones or headphones may not always work properly. Common problems are distorted audio, low level with the volume at maximum, or high level with the volume at minimum. This bulletin will explain earphone/headphone specifications, which ones are important, and how to choose earphones for an audio system.\n\nLet's differentiate between headphones and earphones. A headphone consists of one or two transducers (usually miniature speakers) that are attached to a metal or plastic headband. This headband provides proper placement of the transducers over the ear; the headband rests on top or behind the head. There are two common types: open-back and closed-back. The open-back type has acoustic ports on the outside that increase bass response, but has the downside of allowing background noise to bleed through into the ear. The closed type completely covers the ear, thus reducing background noise. A secondary advantage is that sound originating from the headphones will not radiate outward. Closed-back are preferred for applications such as studio recording where noise must be minimized.\n\nEarphones are also transducers but with no headband. They can be placed on the pinna (earflap) or inside the ear canal. The former, known as \"earbuds\", are usually the open-air type, since small transducers can not generate low frequencies without acoustic ports. The latter, known as \"in ear\" earphones, use a foam or other soft material to hold the earphone in the ear canal, thus isolating it from ambient noise. Forming an acoustic seal makes the ear canal part of the earphone \"system\" and modifies its frequency response. The advantages are that less volume is required, and audio quality is typically better.\n\nMost headphone and earphone specifications show actual impedance and sensitivity. Some others go a step further and show maximum/clipping level and frequency response. These specifications define how each unit will work with an audio system. On the audio system side, pertinent specifications are output impedance, power output, and/or clipping level.\n\nImpedance\n\nImpedance is opposition to the flow of current. The higher impedance, the less current will flow. Impedance is measured in Ohms, indicated by the Greek sign Omega (\u03a9). Earphones and headphones range from 8 Ohms to 600 Ohms or higher. The audio source (the headphone output) also has an impedance rating. To obtain maximum power transfer (all usable power from the source reaches the earphones) impedances should match. However, that's rarely the case. When impedances don't match, there is either a loss of voltage or of current, in other words, a loss of power. This power loss can be calculated with the following formula:\nWhere\n- RS: Source impedance (the impedance of the audio system's headphone output)\n- RL: Load impedance (the impedance of the earphones or headphones)\n\nLet's assume we want to use earphones with an impedance of 110 Ohms. If connected to a source that matches this impedance, the above formula shows a loss of -6.0 dB. Even though there is maximum power transfer, there is a loss. This is called load loss and there's no way to avoid it. For example, using a higher source impedance, say 600 Ohms, the power loss becomes -8.8 dB. This is nearly 3 dB lower than before; -3 dB represents half the power. Using a lower source impedance, say 16 Ohms, the power loss is 9.5 dB. Note that the load loss increases if the source impedance is higher or is lower than the exact earphone impedance. Figure #1 shows the power loss for different earphones driven by different source impedances.\n\nIn most cases, load loss is not critical. A headphone amplifier typically can deliver far more power than needed, thus overcoming the effect of unmatched impedances.\n\nFigure #1. Power loss at different source impedances for different earphones.\nSensitivity\n\nSensitivity is how effectively an earphone converts an electrical signal into an acoustical signal. Sensitivity indicates how loud the earphones will be for a given level from the source.\nThis measurement is given in decibels of Sound Pressure Level per milliwatt, or dB SPL/mW. In some cases it might be shown as dB/mW and is based on a 1 mW input signal. One mW is one thousandths of a Watt, or 0.001 Watts. The sensitivity of earphones is usually in the range of 80 to 125 dB SPL/mW. Here is an example. An earphone's sensitivity is 122 dB SPL/mW. This means 1 mW of power will generate 122 dB SPL. This SPL level is over the threshold of pain and can cause permanent hearing damage in a short amount of time. Figure #2 shows different levels in dB SPL and the exposure time before hearing damage may occur. A typical headphone output could provide this level. Note that dB SPL do not sum in a linear manner; 2 mW into the earphone will not generate 244 dB SPL. Doubling or halving the input power increases or decreases the SPL by 3 dB. A .5 mW input into the earphone will generate 119 dB SPL. A sensitivity rating doesnt mean much until it is matched with the output capabilities of an audio system. If a system has low output level, using a low sensitivity earphone will result in low SPL. Increasing the amplifier level in this configuration will lead to distorted audio due to amplifier clipping. On the other hand, a high sensitivity earphone coupled with a high power headphone amplifier will force a low volume setting, and than can result in more noise. A classic case of this problem is connecting a pair ofefficient earhonesto an airplane sound system. Setting the volume at the first position, right above zero, gives enough level but is noisy. Increasing the volume makes it too loud to use. A simple, passive headphone attenuator solves this problem by reducing the level being delivered to the headphones, allowing you to raise the volume of the headphone amplifier to a setting that produces less noise. The following table shows the SPL output level for the different earphones at different source levels.\nInput power (mW)\nEarphone #1\n113.5 dB SPL/mW\nEarphone #2\n105 dB SPL/mW\nEarphone #3\n122 dB SPL/mW\n0.1 103.5 95.0 112.0\n0.2 106.5 98.0 115.0\n0.5 110.5 102.0 119.0\n0.8 112.5 104.0 121.0\n1.0 113.5 105.0 122.0\n1.2 114.3 105.8 122.8\n1.5 115.3 106.8 123.8\nFrequency Response\n\nWhen the frequency response is given as a graph, it indicates two different measurements. One, it shows the range of frequencies, lowest to highest, reproduced by the earphone. Two, it shows the relative output level of the earphone at each frequency. Frequency response is measured in Hertz (Hz) and covers the audible range between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Measuring frequency response in earphones is not a simple task. It requires the use of a \"dummy head\". The dummy head resembles a human head and has a measurement microphone inside each ear canal. Proper measurement of headphone frequency response is straightforward as the headphones are placed over the dummy ears. Measuring earphones is a different matter. When proper earphone placement is achieved, the ear canal becomes part of the earphone and affects the frequency response. Since each person has a different ear canal (depth, diameter, curvature, etc.) the frequency response will vary. In fact, it is likely that frequency response will vary between both ears of the same person. Therefore, a frequency response graph for earphones created using a dummy head is not a meaningful measurement.\n\nClipping Level or Maximum Level\n\nEarphone specifications rarely show clipping level or maximum input level. However, the audio source equipment might show this specification for the headphone output. In this case it will indicate the level at which the headphone amplifier begins to clip and the audio signal becomes noticeably distorted. Depending on the impedance and sensitivity of the earphones connected, this might be important. If sensitivity is low and/or the earphone impedance is significantly different than the source impedance, a high level output might be needed to compensate for the load loss and to get usable sound pressure level. If the required level is above the maximum output level of the headphone amplifier, the audio signal will be distorted and may cause damage to the earphones. Using an external battery operated headphone amplifier may solve this problem."}, {"question": "I am using a PGXD.

Every 15 minutes, this phone control center would emit a very strong (almost one watt!), 900 MHz band signal that queried the wireless phones: \"Are you on?\" \"What frequency are you using?\" This RF burst from the phone system produced one second of audible interference in the PGXD every 15 minutes.\nA \"timing mat\" used at high school and college wrestling matches. This caused a repetitive loss of the PGXD audio signal.\nA Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) system used for running races. Each runner has a unique RFID tag. As the runner crosses over an antenna placed on the ground, the exact time of the crossing is logged.\nA medical device that transmits patient data such as blood pressure, pulse, etc.\nSources of PGXD interference are typically nearby. When seeking the source of interference, look for devices with antennas which are within 200 feet of the PGXD receiver.\n\nIn the examples given, there were three possible solutions:\nReplace the PGXD with a system that operates in the UHF TV band, such as the analog BLX series; or\nPower off (or replace) the device causing the interference; or\nContact Shure Service in the United States at 800-516-2525. The PGXD4 receiver can be updated by Shure Service with new firmware that momentarily mutes the audio output when bursts of interference are detected. If you already hear multiple quick mutes/silences, the correct firmware is installed.\nA simple test to determine if the problem is local interference is to operate the PGXD in a different environment, at least one mile away from the venue. If the root cause is local interference, the PGXD will work fine in a different environment. If the PGXD needs repair, it will work poorly no matter where it is used. A more accurate test is for a local wireless microphone expert to employ an RF spectrum analyzer. The analyzer can display the frequency and strength of the signal causing the interference."}, {"question": "When were the Centraverse CVEG and CVFG product variants discontinued?", "answer": "Answer\nEnd of Life Notification: In January 2022, Shure announced the discontinuation of CVEG and CVFG SKU variants in China.\n\nThese variants of Centraverse Gooseneck Microphones are legacy SKUs which were previously introduced in China for channel management purposes.

By using the proper cable type with proven grounding and isolation techniques it is often possible to stop the noise before it enters the audio system. Audio (and video) cables are extremely sensitive to electromagnetic induction (EMI), electrostatic coupling, radio frequency interference (RFI) and changes in capacitance. Cables must be designed and manufactured to eliminate or minimize the factors which contribute to unwanted line noise, electrostatic hum, crosstalk, and noise induced by cable handling.\n\nElectro-Magnetic Induction (EMI)\n\nElectrons in motion create magnetic fields. Sources of these fields can be power cables, motors, power transformers, fluorescent light ballasts and SCRs as dimmers. These magnetic fields, and the resultant changes from constantly varying voltages, can induce a voltage in neighboring conductors which is heard as a buzz or hum. Twisting a cable's inner conductors minimizes susceptibility to this phenomena. Where there are multiple conductor pairs twisting them with varying \"lays\" so the fields do not align also minimizes EMI.\n\nElectrostatic Hum\n\nIn an AC circuit, hum results from voltage being electrostatically coupled into the cable due to the capacitive reactance inherent between power and audio signal lines. The higher the capacitive reactance and the higher the impedance, the higher the induced noise. Additionally, the longer the cable run, the more susceptible the cable will be to hum. A properly grounded cable shield can eliminate this noise and the effectivity is proportional to the cable shield's coverage. Braid shield can provide up to 95% coverage. Foil shields can provide up to 100% coverage. When the utmost in cable flexibility is required a spirally served shield with multiple strands of fine wire can be used. Foil/tape shields do not have the flexibility of braid or spiral shields, and have a tendency to open under severe or multiple bending cycles. It is for this reason that foil shield cables are not typically chosen for microphone or instrument applications which require portability and movement. When 100% coverage is called for, as in digital broadcasting applications, double braids or a combination of foil/tape and braid can be utilized. As mentioned, the longer the cable, the more critical the shielding becomes.\n\nRadio Frequency Interference (RFI)\n\nComplex audio systems use a vast collection of equipment, all operating at different voltage levels and frequencies. Some of this equipment may radiate stray radio waves. Cables, which act like transmitting antennas, propagate this radiation. Cables are also receiving antennas and can contribute to the noise problem evidenced by buzz or hum. Properly grounded cable shielding greatly minimizes this problem. Cables are available with foil/tape shields, braid shields, spiral shields, and combinations of the shield types. All have their specific advantages and cost considerations so should be selected based on exact application.\n\nHandling Noise\n\nThis source of noise is induced as a result of changes in capacitance. When cables are bent, subjected to vibration, impacted, or crushed, the distance between conductors or between conductors and shields is changed. This results in a change of capacitance between conductors and that leads to changes in the voltage difference between conductors. A change in voltage will induce noise into the cable. Cables can be constructed with fillers where to give the cables strength, mechanical stability, and durability.\n\nStatic\n\nNoise can be induced by the static build-up of electrons as a result of cables rubbing against each other or being dragged along carpets. The use of insulating material inside the cable shields can dissipate static noise, improve shield density, and further reduce noise inherent in normal handling.\n\nGround Loops\n\nWhen a cable connecting two pieces of audio equipment is grounded at both ends, buzz or hum can be created by undesirable current flow in the cable shield. The cable provides a ground path that is in addition to the hard wired AC power line grounds. This condition is called a ground loop. The resulting electrical potential differences lead to the undesirable current flow that causes hum. In severe cases the ground loop provides a return path for very high frequency internal equipment oscillation and this can cause audible distortion. A ground loop can often be eliminated by disconnecting the shield at one end of the cable. Note: never disconnect the shield on a cable used to connect a microphone to a mixer or other equipment.\n\nCrosstalk\n\nCrosstalk is when signals enter adjacent channels of multi-conductor cables by capacitive coupling or electromagnetic induction. Shielding each channel signal path and inserting twists in the conductors will minimize crosstalk. In higher impedance applications, e.g. digital audio applications, \"Star Quad\" cable construction will reduce induced noise levels.\n\nSource:  U.S. website of Draka Comteq"}, {"question": "Is there an analogy between signal to noise ratio at a loud party and the operation of a wireless microphone or a wireless PSM system?", "answer": "Answer\nYes, indeed there is. Please read below:\n\nConversation at a Loud Party\u2026and Wireless Microphones\n\nRecently, I arrived early for a party. The host was working in the kitchen 20 feet from where I stood. \"Have a seat and I will tell you what's been going on,\" she said. I settled into a nearby comfy chair and we chatted. The house was quiet and it was no problem to converse even though the talker/transmitter (the host) was located 20 feet from the listener/receiver (me).\n\nLater that evening, the house was filled with guests when the host decided to continue the earlier conversation. But to hear each other we had to be one foot apart\u2026the talker/transmitter had to be much closer to the listener/receiver. What changed?\n\nThe answer: the ambient (background) noise level had increased due to the many conversations in the room. For me, the host's voice was the signal that I wanted to hear. All other sounds were noise, because these were signals that did not interest me. Yet when I arrived at the party and the noise level was quite low, I could be 20 feet away and still have a conversation.\n\nThis is a practical demonstration of Signal-to-Noise Ratio. The signal is the voice of the host; the noise is everything else. The noise is uncorrelated (random) acoustical debris. If the level of the noise is greater than the level of the signal, I cannot understand what is being said. Everyone has experienced a poor Signal-to-Noise Ratio at a party, or a rock concert, or sporting event. Noise creates an acoustical fog that makes it difficult, or impossible, to understand what is being said.\n\nHere is a related question: Why might a Shure wireless mic system work properly over a distance of 500 feet in the Utah desert, while the same exact Shure wireless system will work properly for only 50 feet in New York City? As the wireless mic system did not change, what did?\n\nThe answer: the ambient (background) RF (Radio Frequency) noise level increased due to the many sources of RF transmission in New York City. Examples are numerous TV station transmitters, two-way radio signals, broadcast radio signals, Wi-Fi, data networks, plus the ubiquitous smartphone, owned by every New Yorker and consistently in use. These signals are uncorrelated waves of electro-magnetic debris. Even though most of these RF noise sources do not operate on the same frequency as the Shure wireless system, these sources raise the level of the RF garbage. This makes it more difficult for the Shure transmitter (talker) to be heard by the Shure receiver (listener). Just like what happened at the party, the receiver has a tough time sorting out the desired transmitter signal from the undesired noise.\n\nIn an environment with a high level of RF noise, the receiver (or the receiver antennas) must be located closer to the transmitter. This improves the RF Signal-to-Noise Ratio. The receiver then can pick up the desired transmitter because the signal is now stronger than the noise.\n\nA wireless receiver can be made more selective (improved ability to sort out the signal from the noise) by adding \"front-end RF filters.\" Located after the antennas, these filters reduce the level of RF noise sent into the receiver. Effective RF filters are expensive thus they are primarily found on higher priced wireless systems."}, {"question": "I purchased a Shure lavalier microphone with a TA4F (also known as TQG) connector, and need to plug it into a PA mixer (which has phantom power).

Here is the link to the data sheet:\n\nhttps://pubs.shure.com/guide/55S-SW/en-US"}, {"question": "What are IP Addresses and Subnet Masks?", "answer": "Answer\nIP Addresses and Subnets can be confusing at times, especially when using IP Address ranges which are less common. This guide will help you understand how IP Addresses and Subnet Masks work, and we offer some recommended settings. This guide only discusses IPv4 addresses. Shure devices do not support IPv6 at this time.\n\nWhat is an IP Address?\n\nAn IP Address is a unique address for a device which sends and receives network traffic on a network. Some devices may have more than one IP Address, because they have multiple internal components which need to communicate, or because they need to operate on multiple networks at the same time.\n\nAn IP Address consists of four numbers called octets that are separated by periods. Each number can range from 0 to 255. An example of an IP Address is: 192.168.1.20.\n\nThere are four very common ranges of IP addresses which are used for private networks. These addresses cannot be accessed over the Internet, and so are suitable for AV networks. If you are not sure what range of addresses to use, you should use one of these:\n192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (65,536 possible IP addresses)\n172.16.0.0 to 172.31.0.0 (1,048,576 possible IP addresses)\n10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (16,777,216 possible IP addresses)\n169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255* (65,536 possible IP addresses)\nNote: The last range, 169.254.x.x, is a special IP address range that is reserved for devices to self-assign an address. You generally do not manually assign addresses in this range, and they are not \"handed out\" by a switch, device, or server. Devices give themselves an address in this range when no DHCP server is present and a static IP address is not configured.\n\nThere are some additional IP Addresses and ranges of IP Addresses you should be aware of:\n0.0.0.0: No IP Address. This is sometimes entered in the Gateway field when you want a network to be isolated. See the section on Subnets and Gateways below.\n127.0.0.1 (and 127.0.0.0-127.255.255.255): This address always sends data back to the device that sent it. It's sometimes called localhost or a loopback address. Do not ever assign an address beginning with 127 to a device.\n224.0.0.0-239.255.255.255: These are Multicast IP Addresses. See Multicast and IGMP In Depth for more information on Multicast IP traffic. You can't assign these addresses to a device as they are not valid device addresses.\nAny other address range not mentioned: other IP addresses should be assumed to be part of an enterprise network which is connected to the public Internet. Do not use those addresses unless your IT department directs you to do so.\nSubnet Masks\n\nA Subnet Mask defines which range of IP Addresses are within a local network, and which ones are not. Subnet masks always work from left to right. Devices are said to be within the same subnet if their IP Address starts with the same digits, but ends with a different set of digits.\n\nSometimes, it's easy to tell which part of an IP address is part of the local network and which is not (when the subnet mask consists only sections that are 255 and 0), but sometimes it may not be as clear.\nExample IP Address 192.168.1.20\nSubnet Mask 255.255.255.0\nStarting Address in Subnet 192.168.1.0\nEnding Address in Subnet 192.168.1.255\n    Example IP Address 192.168.1.20\nSubnet Mask 255.255.0.0\nStarting Address in Subnet 192.168.0.0\nEnding Address in Subnet 192.168.255.255\n    Example IP Address 192.168.1.20\nSubnet Mask 255.0.0.0\nStarting Address in Subnet 192.0.0.0\nEnding Address in Subnet 192.255.255.255\nIf the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, then the first three octets of all devices must be the same. The 4th octet must be different and unique. A maximum of 254 devices can be used in this subnet.\n\nIf the subnet mask is 255.255.0.0, then the first two octets of all devices must be the same. The combination of the last two octets must be different and unique. 65,534 devices can be used in this subnet.\n\nThe very first address and very last address in a subnet are specially reserved addresses and cannot be assigned to devices. Devices that are within the same subnet will be able to communicate with one another, but a gateway is required to communicate with devices in different subnets.\n\nGateways (or Routers)\n\nWhen traffic is intended for a device outside of the subnet, it is sent to the gateway to be routed to the correct destination. The gateway is a device on the network which has multiple networks configured. For example, a gateway on a home network generally sees the local network (e.g., 192.168.0.x) as well as the ISP (Internet Service Provider) network. The gateway takes local traffic for the internet and sends it along to the ISP, and then sends the response back to the device that originally sent the request.\n\nDevices on isolated networks, such as AV networks which do not connect to the Internet) should not have a gateway assigned. This can cause unexpected behavior because devices may attempt to contact the non-existent gateway. If the field must be filled in, enter 0.0.0.0.\n\nRecommended Settings\n\nGenerally, we recommend you set your devices for Automatic or DHCP mode. A DHCP server on the network isn't required, but it is fine if one is present. For Dante-enabled devices, both the Shure Control and Network Audio addresses should be set to Automatic or DHCP (don't set one to Static and the other to Automatic).\nIf a DHCP server is present, devices will get an IP Address in the DHCP range like 192.168.1.x.\nIf no DHCP server is present, devices will get an IP address in the 169.254.x.x range with a 255.255.0.0 subnet mask. This is perfectly fine.\nStatic IP Addresses\n\nIf you must use static IP addresses for your network, be sure that both Shure Control and Network Audio address for all devices are within the same subnet, and that all devices have unique IP addresses. We recommend that you maintain a list of all IP addresses in use to avoid conflicts. Do not assign a gateway address if there is no internet connection.\n\nSeparating Traffic\nIn some cases, it is desired to separate Dante traffic from Control traffic. This can be done with some Shure devices which have multiple Ethernet ports by setting them to the Split mode. However, it is not possible to just configure IP addresses in different ranges in an attempt to separate traffic on the same switch or VLAN. This can lead to a number of issues, including devices which cannot communicate with one another, and will not prevent multicast and broadcast traffic from reaching undesired destinations in many situations."}, {"question": "Can I route audio from an MXWAPT or MXA910 directly to a Biamp Tesira, QSC Core, or other third-party DSP which supports Dante or AES67?", "answer": "Answer\nYes, you can route audio from an MXWAPT or MXA910 or other Shure Dante-enabled devices to a DSP which supports Dante or AES67 without converting the audio to analog first.\n\nIMPORTANT: If one or more MXWAPT devices are present on the network, an MXWAPT must be the Primary Leader Clock.

This occurs when you have a SERVER-IO with both AVB and Dante cards. In this situation, the Tesira locks out user control of this setting so as not to break clock propagation between AVB and Dante (or CobraNet, if you\u2019re using that).\n\nThe way to change clock priority is to go to the Media Networks dialog: System > Media Networks > Setup in the Tesira software. Set the Tesira to clock from the Dante network, and this will clear the Preferred Leader flag in Dante Controller and configure the Tesira to sync to the Dante clock (including the AVB card).\n\nNote that this dialog is telling Tesira on which network the Leading Clock will be, which is why it might appear to work backwards at first glance. It tells Tesira that it must sync to the incoming Dante clock and push that clock onto any connected AVB or CobraNet networks.\n\n\nSee these documents for more information:\nhttps://support.biamp.com/Tesira/Miscellaneous/Tesira_release_notes\nhttps://support.biamp.com/Tesira/Control/Using_multiple_networked_audio_protocols\nNotes for QSC Core Installations\nIf you followed QSC guides to configure your network switch, you may need to make some adjustments to the switch configuration to make devices appear correctly.

", "answer": "Answer\nTo help ensure your batteries are good to go the next time you need them, here are some helpful pointers to help prevent your Lithium Ion batteries from discharging to a point where they can't be recovered: \n\n1.    Manage Charge Status  \nAs available for your rechargeable product batteries, use Storage Mode.  When Shure rechargeable batteries will not be used for extended periods of time, Storage Mode will leave the battery in a slightly depleted state that is optimal for long-term storage. \n  If your charger does not support Storage mode, then charge the batteries to full as you normally would. Under no circumstance would you want to store batteries that have been fully discharged. \n \n2.    Store Batteries Separately \nRemovable batteries should be taken out of any charger or device when storing for extended periods.\u202f If the battery is built into the device, then make sure any switches or power are set to off. \n \n3.    Store at Room Temperature \nBatteries should be stored in a controlled, room temperature environment, so the temperature remains relatively steady.\u202f Normal HVAC with a thermostat is perfectly adequate.\u202f \n  Large temperature fluctuations, or extreme hot or cold storage, will speed up and increase\u202fthe\u202faging of a lithium-ion battery. \n\n4.    Long-term Storage\nIf rechargeable batteries need to be stored for longer than one week, we highly recommend that they be recharged every six months using your Shure charger\u2019s Storage Mode feature.\n  If Storage Mode is not an option, recharging to full is an acceptable solution.  \n\nAs a general rule, remove lithium-ion-powered devices and batteries when fully charged and store outside the charger for best lithium-ion battery health.  Note: while these techniques can help maintain battery life, lithium-ion batteries do age and degrade over time.\n\nThese guidelines are intended as a general explanation of how to handle Shure lithium-ion batteries.  Always reference Shure product user guide and supporting documentation, and any applicable health and safety regulations, for any specific handling instructions.\n\nQuick hits:\n- Do not store batteries that are totally discharged!\n- Long term storage should use Storage Mode and should be checked and/or recharged every 6 months.\n "}, {"question": "When was the SM7B label changed to add the Russia, China RoHS, UK Compliance symbols?", "answer": "Answer\nThe label on the mic was changed in May 2021 to add these symbols:"}, {"question": "How do I route AES67 streams from a QSC Core to a Shure Dante-enabled device? I want to send audio to the AEC Reference In of my MXA910/MXA710.", "answer": "Answer\nAES67 streams can be routed to a Shure Dante-enabled device with the following instructions.\nWe highly recommend that you route an AES67 AEC reference back to a Dante device that supports it (such as MXA910 and MXA710) when using AES67 to a third-party DSP. The article How does Autofocus work on the MXA910? explains why.\n\nTo create the AES67 stream for a Dante device, follow these steps:\nEnsure AES67 is enabled on your Dante device.

See Configuring a Network Switch for Shure Devices and Dante/AES67 for switch-specific configuration guides.\n\nIf you are connecting or uplinking to a campus, corporate, or enterprise network, we highly recommend bringing all equipment back to the IDF and connecting to enterprise-grade access-layer switches. We also recommend that your VLANs do not span across buildings and that their IPv4 Subnet Mask is /24 (255.255.255.0; total of 254 IP addresses) or smaller. See our Enterprise Network Troubleshooting Checklist for more details.\n\nHere are some additional tips for selecting a switch:\nAvoid switches on our list of Disqualified Network Switches for Shure Dante Devices.\nA Gigabit switch is recommended especially for connections between devices sending Audio over IP in the system. Examples of such devices are Microflex Wireless components (MXWAPT, MXWANI), Microflex Advance products (MXA910, MXA710, MXA310), Audio Processors (P300-IMX, IntelliMix Room), and Audio Interfaces (ANI devices).\nGenerally, a managed switch that has a built-in graphical user interface is preferred because it will allow you to turn on or off any features that could affect performance of the system and network.\nThe switch should support DSCP, often referred to as QoS (Quality of Service). Generally, this protocol is turned on but may need to be manually configured depending on the network topology or settings.  If you are unsure about this, you may need to contact the IT department or network administrator that is responsible for the network.\nAvoid switches that employ the 802.3az protocol, otherwise referred to as Energy Efficient Ethernet, or select a managed switch that will allow you to turn this feature OFF even if the switch employs. This feature is intended to conserve energy by putting currently unused ports into a \"sleep\" state. This kind of operation can cause interruptions in Dante and AES67 clocking, which will lead to dropouts. This is particularly problematic for systems involving multiple Microflex Wireless Access Points.\nIf you intend to connect an MXA910, MXA710, MXA310, ANI4IN, ANI4OUT, ANI22, or MXWAPT to a switch directly, that switch will need to have ports that supply PoE (Power over Ethernet). The power requirement for each most devices is 6.5W (Class 0 PoE). A Shure P300 requires a PoE+ capable switch."}, {"question": "Why does the MXWAPT have \"Sync to External\" checked in Dante Controller?", "answer": "Answer\nThe Dante Controller column labels are from the perspective of the Dante FPGA living inside the Shure device circuitry. The APT has a high stability clock that feeds the Dante FPGA with the 'golden' time reference for its network clock. To the Dante FPGA, it's 'external' and in controller they label it as such.\n\nIt's also the reason why we say \"you have to use the MXWAPT as the Dante clock Primary Leader\" because we know our clock has high enough stability to guarantee our DECT transmit timing coordination between MXWAPTs. The Primary Leader clock MXWAPT essentially derives the DECT timing off the high stability. The other MXWAPTs utilize the incoming Dante clock timing off the network to keep the DECT transmit timing synced.\n "}, {"question": "Does the DIS-CCU central control unit include a power supply?", "answer": "Answer\nThe DIS-CCU is available with or without an included power supply, depending on region.

How do I fix it?", "answer": "Answer\nHere's a common story: a customer purchases a Shure PSM (Personal Stereo Monitor) system and installs the PSM transmitter in the equipment rack next to a Shure wireless mic receiver. At the rear of the rack, the PSM transmit antenna is six inches away from the wireless mic receive antennas. Or, all of the equipment have their antennas mounted on the front of the rack, inches away from one another. When the PSM transmitter is operating, the wireless mic system becomes unreliable, exhibiting numerous drop-outs. Power off the PSM transmitter and the wireless mic operates just fine.\n\nNow here is the rub: it is not a frequency issue. The frequencies were properly coordinated to avoid interference between the units. So what is the root cause? It's called Desensitization, or Desense. An analogy will explain.\n\nYou are sitting in a dark room and your eyes have adjusted to the darkness. In the far corner, there is a nightlight with a very low wattage light bulb. You can easily see the glow emitted from the nightlight. Suddenly, a bright ceiling light is switched on and then off. For some time, you can no longer see the nightlight glow because your eyes have been \"de-sensitized\" by the bright light.\n\nThe dim nightlight is the wireless mic transmitter. Your eyes are the wireless mic receiver. The bright ceiling light is the PSM transmitter. Because the PSM transmit antenna is very close to the wireless mic receive antennas, the wireless mic receiver is overloaded (or swamped) by the strong PSM signal. The wireless mic receiver can no longer \"see\" the tiny signal coming in from the its transmitter. The receiver has been de-sensitized by the strong PSM signal, just like your eyes were de-sensitized by the bright ceiling light.\n\nHow much stronger is the PSM signal because of its proximate position to the wireless mic receiver? Let's assume that the mic transmitter and the PSM transmitter are emitting the same signal strength. However, the wireless mic transmit antenna is 20 feet away from the receiving antennas, while the PSM transmit antenna is 0.5 feet away. This difference in distance provides a difference in signal level of over 30 dB! The wireless mic receiver is being \"blinded\" by the strong signal from the neighboring PSM transmitter.\n\nThe solution is to separate the PSM transmit antenna from the wireless mic receive antennas. But how great must the separation be? There is no hard and fast rule. The answer is \"farther is better.\"  As a starting point, ten to fifteen feet (three to five meters) of separation is suggested. If you have multiple PSM units, it can be helpful to combine their signal with a PA411 (for PSM300) or a PA421B or PA821B (PSM900/PSM1000), and then mount a PA805SWB antenna on a mic stand 10-15 feet away. In this situation, all of the equipment can live in the same rack because the transmit antenna is separated.\n\nThough it may be convenient to mount a PSM transmitter in the same rack as the wireless mic receiver, it is not best practice. The PSM transmit antenna and the wireless mic receive antennas will be too close for comfort."}, {"question": "What are the differences between AONIC FREE and AONIC 215 True Wireless (2nd Generation)?", "answer": "Answer\nWhile the AONIC FREE and the AONIC 215 are both True Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones developed by Shure, they differ in a few key areas \u2013 particularly in design. \n\nAONIC 215: \n\nThe AONIC 215 features a detachable MMCX connection, which enables a user to convert to a wired connection with a separately available accessory (RMCE-UNI).   \n\nThis model also features an over-ear hook design with button controls behind the ear and is IPX4-rated for sweat and water resistance.   \n\nThe carrying case is a zippered, round style and provides 3 additional charges for a total of up to 32 hours battery life.

When you resume music by performing another press, the Environment Mode is automatically disabled and the music resumes. You can activate this feature from the ShurePlus PLAY app. \n\n\nWhat drivers and audio technologies are used in the AONIC free? How does it differ from the existing Shure earphone line? \n\nThe AONIC FREE uses a premium dynamic driver with excellent audio specs - low harmonic distortion, smooth extension, and a natural, balanced frequency response. But comparing drivers to existing models only tells a fraction of the story when it comes to the audio design of the AONIC FREE. While the choice of driver establishes a critical foundation, the mechanical enclosure and tuning of the audio path are all equally important to delivering the ultimate sound signature. On top of all that, the AONIC FREE sports a configurable EQ (set to Flat by default), which users can customize to match their preferred frequency response and save as a preset directly to the earphone. \n \n\nWhat is Sound Isolating\u2122 technology? \n\nShure\u2019s Sound Isolating technology naturally blocks up to 37dB of unwanted outside noise. Unlike Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), Sound Isolation is a passive solution. This means that it does not require battery power and does not introduce any additional audio artifacts which can sometimes result from ANC processing. To bypass Sound Isolation, simply press twice on either earphone to activate Environment Mode. This will turn on the ambient mics when you need to be aware of your surroundings. For an even quicker bypass, select PausePlus from the PLAY app; this will pause your music and activate Environment Mode with a single press.  \n\nCan I customize the button functions on the AONIC FREE? \n\nYes.

How do I know the earphones are inserted properly in the case?  \n\nFor proper charging, insert the earphones into the case. The earphone LEDs will illuminate solid RED to indicate that they are being charged by the charging case. The earphone LEDs will turn off when charging is complete. \n\n \n\nWhat does the light on the case do?  \n\nWhen not plugged in: GREEN means the case has enough battery to fully charge a set of earphones. RED means the case battery is too low to support a full charge of earphones. \n\nWhen plugged in: RED means the case is charging. GREEN means it is fully charged.  \n\n\n\nWhat do the earphone LEDs indicate? \nFlashing Blue and Red = Pairing Mode \nFlashing Red = Low Battery \n1s Single Blue Flash = Power On \n1s Single Red Flash = Power Off \nSolid Red LED when in case = Charging \n1s Repeated Blue Flash = Link Loss (Primary adapter has lost contact with host) \nSolid Red during phone call = On A Call (configurable in PLAY app)\n\nHow do I know which side is the Primary? (The Active Mic for Phone Calls) \n\nAlthough you hear call audio in both ears, only one side sends the audio from your end of a phone call. That side - known as the \u201cPrimary\u201d  - is identified in the ShurePlus PLAY App. \n\nTo configure which side is the Primary, choose the side you prefer for phone calls, and remove that side from the case first.    \n\nThe first adapter that the phone/computer \u201csees\u201d will become the Primary for that session only. That adapter will remain the Primary until any one of the following events occur: \nThe unit is returned to the Charging Case.  \nThe unit is powered OFF (via long-press of the adapter\u2019s multi-function button). \nThe unit goes out of RF range of the host (e.g., your phone or PC). \nThe unit powers OFF automatically due to a Low Battery condition. \nWhen any of those events occur, the Secondary unit (if present) will take over from the Primary. \n\nThe Mute tone (triple press during a call to active/deactivate) will only be heard in the Primary. \n\n\nHow do I clear the PDL (Paired Device List)?  \n\nYou can clear from the PLAY app or put both adapters in case and hold down buttons for 7 seconds. \n\n \nHow do I order replacement earphone sleeves? \n\nThe AONIC Free are supplied with one set each of small, medium (attached), and large Comply\u2122 100 Series premium sound-isolating foam sleeves. Replacements may be ordered directly from Comply. Shure Black Foam Replacement Sleeves (EABKF1) are also compatible and may be ordered directly from Shure. \n\n\nHow do I peer pair a replacement earphone? \n\nThe peer pairing process wirelessly pairs one earphone to another so that they work as a set. To pair your new earphone to your old earphone, put both earphones in the charging case and hold down the buttons for 7 seconds, until the earphone LEDs begin flashing blue. \n\n\nIf I lose a unit and receive a replacement, how do I pair it to my other adapter?  \n\nTo peer pair, put both adapters in case and hold down buttons for 7 seconds. This also clears the PDL. Once you have peer-paired the modules to each other, be sure to use the PLAY app to update the firmware so that the new and old earbuds are both running on the same firmware. \n\n \n\nWhy are my device settings \u201cgrayed out\u201d in the PLAY app? Why can\u2019t I change settings? \n\nIf you are only using one earbud, you will not be able to change system settings like Pause Plus or Environment Mode. System changes are only allowed when both earbuds are \u201cseen\u201d by the host. Likewise, both earbuds must be on the same firmware version. If Right and Left are on different firmware versions, the PLAY app will disable any of the customization options. \n\n \n\nIf I lose the charging case and buy a new one, do I need to pair it with the earphones?  \n\nNo. The new case will support the original earphones \n\n\nWhy does it keep going into pairing mode?  \n\nIf you manually Power ON either earphone (via a long-press of the earphone\u2019s multi-function button), and continue pressing after you hear the \u201cPower On\u201d prompt, you will enter into Bluetooth Pairing Mode. It is important to release the button after you hear the \u201cPower On\u201d prompt unless you want to enter Bluetooth Pairing Mode. \n\n \nHow many microphones are there in the AONIC FREE earphones? \n\nThere are two microphones on each earphone. On each there is one mic for Voice and one mic for Environment Mode. They work together in conjunction with DSP (\u201cbeamforming\u201d) to improve voice intelligibility. \n\n\nWhat Bluetooth 5.0 profiles are supported?  \n\nA2DP 1.3.1, AVRCP 1.6, GAVDP 1.3, HFP 1.7.1, HSP 1.2 \n \n\nDoes this product support role swapping? \n\nYes. Either Left or Right side can be the Primary (the Primary unit is the side that \u201ctalks\u201d to the phone). When you remove them from the case, the first one the phone \u201csees\u201d will become the Primary. It will remain the Primary until you manually Power OFF, put it back in the Charging Case, or it goes out of range of the RF host, or the battery dies. If any of these events occur, the Secondary (if present) will automatically take over and become the Primary.  \nIs there Multipoint Pairing? \n\nMultipoint pairing is not supported.  \n\n\nHow many devices can it store in memory?  \n\nUp to 8. The oldest will be overwritten by the newest. \n\n\nHow do I reset to factory defaults? \n\nYou can reset by using the ShurePlus PLAY app. \n\n\nSometimes I hear a high-pitched \u201chowling\u201d when using Environment Mode. \n\nEnvironment Mode allows you to hear the outside world with the touch of a button. If you cup your eaphone in your hand while Environment Mode is On, the unit may produce feedback (howling). Sometimes this may cause the unit to shut down, but it will not damage the earphone. \n \n\nOverload Shutdown \n\nAn overload shutdown protects the battery circuit from damage. If you experience an overload shutdown it may be necessary to return units to the charging case before powering on again. \n\n\nIs AONIC FREE MS Teams Certified? \n\nAONIC Free is not UC or MS Teams certified. \n  In what situations does this earphone perform best? \nThis product is designed for music listening and communication in any situation. It is great at home, in the office, on-the-go or at the gym. It works for listening to music, movies and podcasts, as well as for conferencing and phone calls.

They can also coexist in a single system without issue but there are some differences between the two:\nThe AD610 allows for both a standard and high RF power setting for potentially improved range while the AXT610 only had a fixed standard RF power (10 dBm ERP). The AD610 selectable power settings are:\nNormal (default) = Operates at 8 dBm\nHigh = Operates at 18 dBm\nEach AD610 can support up to 24 Axient transmitters at one time while each AXT610 was only able to support up to 16 Axient transmitters.\nThe AD610 is a diversity access point (two antennas) which can improve reception especially in reflective and/or congested RF environments. In comparison, the original AXT610 was a non-diversity access point (one antenna). Both, though, still have a separate dedicated antenna for scanning and evaluating the environment.\nThe AD610 allows for connection of the new ADX5D dual camera slot portable receiver to a ShowLink network. However, the AXT610 is NOT compatible with the ADX5D in any way."}, {"question": "Are there any major diferences between the \"BETA 58A\" and the older \"BETA 58\"?", "answer": "Answer\nThe Beta 58A has a completely new cartridge in it.

This FAQ is intended to help Enterprise Network Administrators ensure that Shure devices will fully function on their networks.\n\nOverview of Network Requirements and Assumptions for Network Audio Devices\nNetwork audio devices, such as Shure products with Dante, behave differently than other media-over-IP solutions such as IPTV, multicast video, and streaming audio. Because audio is sent in real-time, low latency and low jitter are required for solid and reliable performance. Additionally, multicast traffic is used for control traffic and clocking, and in some cases for audio data transport as well.\n\nThis guide walks through the various recommendations and requirements to make your network audio deployment successful. \nPhysical Layer and Network Topology\nGenerally, Shure devices expect to all be on the same VLAN and to be able to communicate between each other and management computers using multicast traffic. You will generally get the best performance if all devices are plugged into the same physical switch or switch stack.\nIf your device network/VLAN has segments which pass through a layer 3 router or a firewall, unexpected behaviour may result. If you run into issues, simplify your network to one switch and check for functionality, then slowly introduce more complexity.\nWe generally recommend that all switches be from the same manufacturer and the same line of products. Mixed-vendor networks can present problems. We do not recommend mixing \"small-business\" switches with enterprise-grade switches.\nShure devices expect all links within the network to be symmetric (in terms of bandwidth, transit time, and jitter). Normal copper and fiber Ethernet links are almost always fine. Technologies such as MPLS, Metro Ethernet, GPON, BPON, and MoCA may violate these assumptions. Traffic shaping should be disabled (see QoS below for more).\nEnsure uplink ports are of sufficient bandwidth to carry all multicast media streams present on the network. On networks with video, this may mean using 10 Gbps+ links.\nBe careful when configuring LAGs to ensure that all components of the lag have identical latency and performance.\nAlways use a cable certifier to ensure all cables are terminated correctly and will be error-free.\nMost Shure devices support Gigabit networks, including all Dante-enabled devices. Some devices, such as chargers, are 10/100 Ethernet (\"Fast Ethernet\"). We highly recommend all devices be connected to Gigabit switchports regardless of device.\nDevice Addressing, Port Security, and Authentication\nShure Dante-enabled devices contain two Ethernet devices internally with separate MAC addresses, and require two IP addresses.\nFor Shure devices with a single Ethernet port, we require that both the Control and Network Audio interfaces be in the same VLAN and within the same subnet.\nWe do not support VLAN Tagging (802.1q) on any Shure products.\nProducts with Ultimo and UltimoX chipsets will not permit firmware updates if the two NICs are configured in different subnets.\nFor Shure devices with multiple network ports (excluding MXWANI), you may elect to separate the Shure Control and Dante traffic if you would prefer to do so. This is a configurable option on the device; see the User's Guide for more information.\nShure devices respond to DHCP out of the box and after factory reset, and will self-assign an IP address in the 169.254.0.0/16 range if no DHCP server is present. There is no hard-coded default address.\nWe recommend DHCP with address reservations for most users. Static address assignment is discouraged due to the potential for accidentally entering duplicate IP addresses.\nIf using switchport security on your switches, ensure that multiple MAC Addresses are permitted on a single switchport.\nIf you are using MAC address authentication with Cisco switches, you may need to configure your switch for authentication host-mode multi-host or multi-auth rather than multi-domain or single-host for Shure devices with two MAC addresses.\nShure devices do not support 802.1x authentication.\nShure devices will not register a hostname with the DHCP server (option 12) for the Shure Control interface. This is expected behavior. The Dante interface will register a hostname.\nShure devices don't require a DNS server to be configured.\nPro tip: Shure MAC Addresses generally begin with 00:0E:DD.\nShure Device Discovery and Updates\nEnsure you are running the latest version of Shure Update Utility and Shure Designer.\nIf devices do not appear, follow this FAQ first: Shure Update Utility: Devices Don't Display.\nShure devices use both Shure Discovery and Bonjour (mDNS) for discovery. Dante uses Bonjour (mDNS) exclusively.\nShure Discovery is on multicast address 239.255.254.253:8427.\nBonjour/mDNS is on multicast address 224.0.0.251:5353.\nNOTE: Some switches have an mDNS Capture/Propagation feature, which when enabled can \"capture\" all mDNS traffic for the purpose of flooding it out. This feature generally needs to be disabled so that the switch does not attempt to block/capture the mDNS traffic. If devices do not appear in Dante Controller or Shure Web Device Discovery, this may be the reason.\nInter-device communication is via unicast UDP traffic, and on a randomly-assigned UDP port per device.\nShure Designer, Shure Update Utility, and Wireless Workbench permit management of devices across VLANs (\"Remote Devices\"). This allows you to manage and update an entire campus from one location. Communication is via unicast UDP, and we expect no packet filtering between VLANs. NAT is not supported due to the UDP sessions.\nUpdates can only be installed with Shure Update Utility or Shure Designer. There is no web page upload option. Download firmware through these programs.\nShure Update Utility needs to be bonded to a specific NIC on a computer, and must be allowed through the PC's Firewall.\nMulticast Settings\nMulticast is used for control traffic and audio clocking, even if multicast audio streams are not used.\nEnsure IGMP Snooping is enabled on your switch for the VLAN with Shure devices. Enterprise networks should have IGMP enabled; running without IGMP snooping is only advised for small networks with a single switch and no AES67 or Dante multicast audio streams.\nOne switch must serve as the IGMP Querier. This is often automatically elected in homogeneous switch environments. The core switch is the preferred querier.\nThe Querier generally needs to have an IP address in the same Layer 3 subnet as the Shure devices. Some switches have workarounds for this requirement; contact your switch manufacturer for more details.\nAll other switches should see the switch with the querier as their mrouter, and the port headed to that switch as an mrouter port.\nWe recommend a querier interval of 30s or less to minimize long outages when the IGMP Snooping table must be rebuilt.\nVerify that the following multicast groups are present in the multicast forwarding database and not blocked by any ACL:\nDante Control Traffic: 224.0.0.230-224.0.0.233 (Dante Cards and Dante Controller - may not be registered via IGMP; we expect these to flood the subnet)\nBonjour/mDNS: 224.0.0.251:5353 (Shure Web Device Discovery, Dante Controller - may not be registered via IGMP; we expect these to flood the subnet)\nPTP Clock: 224.0.1.129:319-320 (Dante Cards - should register with IGMP)\nShure Discovery: 239.255.254.253:8427 (Shure Update Utility, Designer, SystemOn, Wireless Workbench - should register with IGMP)\nSAP (AES67): 239.255.255.255:9875 (AES67 Announcements - should register with IMGP)\nSee Which network ports does Dante use? for additional information.\nNOTE: We expect traffic in the 224.0.0.0/24 range to flood the VLAN. Some networks do not always flood this traffic, especially in environments where a L2 VLAN spans multiple switches connected via a router. You may need to make adjustments to your switch or router to ensure this traffic floods, including manually adding required groups to the multicast forwarding database.\nShure devices generally do not expect multicast to be routed across subnets. In networks where multicast is permitted to flow across VLANs, unexpected behaviour may occur. Contact Shure Applications Engineering if this is the case for your network.\nIf a device is not seeing some multicast traffic, check the switch to ensure that switchport is joined to the correct multicast groups.\nIn larger networks, where traffic must traverse a core switch from one edge switch to another, it may be necessary to enable PIM Sparse Mode on the core switch. Confer with your network engineering team before making this change.\nEnsure Multicast Storm Control is disabled on switchports that Shure devices are connected to.\nIn some cases, customers may wish to block multicast traffic between switchports on the same VLAN. This is done sometimes when each room has its own small switch to create small multicast domains which do not flood the entire VLAN. In this case, you will not be able to remotely discover Shure devices from a central location. You will need to connect to the devices via IP Address from Designer, Shure Update Utility, or Wireless Workbench.\nQoS Settings\nShure Network Audio devices assign DSCP values to traffic. You should configure your network to trust these values.\nHere are the recommend settings:\nDSCP 56 should be assigned to a dedicated queue with the highest priority on the network.\nDSCP 46 should be assigned to a dedicated queue with the second highest priority on the network.\nDSCP 34 should be assigned to a dedicated queue with the third highest priority on the network.\nEnsure that trunk ports respect DSCP tags, even across VLANs. This is critical to ensure clock traffic timing is maintained.\nIMPORTANT: Shure devices which support DDM and are running Dante firmware 4.x use different QOS settings for AES67 compared to devices running Dante firmware 3.x.\nDante 4.x: Clock is DSCP 46; Audio is DSCP 34 (matches AES67 standard).\nDante 3.x: Clock is DSCP 56, Audio is DSCP 46 (matches Audinate standard).\nClock Traffic (PTP)\nClock traffic is the most important network traffic exchanged by Shure Network Audio devices.\nClock traffic is in multicast group 224.0.1.129:319-320.\nReview the QOS notes above. There are differences between Dante firmware versions used in Shure devices.\nIf multiple leader clocks are detected, this means that all devices are not seeing the PTP traffic, some packets are getting dropped, or that packets are being delayed excessively. Check multicast group membership for group 224.0.1.129 and check Multicast Storm Control. Ensure all devices appear fully in Dante Controller.\nIf excessive jitter is detected, this means that QOS is not configured correctly. Verify clock traffic is in a dedicated queue with the highest priority, including on trunk and LAG interfaces.\nEnsure no devices are connected to an unmanaged switch which is connected to an enterprise switch. Some low-end switches employ low cost store-and-forward chipsets which are not compatible with network audio traffic.\nIf your switches support PTPv2 E2E Transparent Clock, we recommend enabling it. Note that this only affects AES67 clocking. Dante clocking with PTPv1 does not support Transparent Clocks.\nAudio Traffic (RTP/RTSP)\nReview the QOS notes above. There are differences between Dante firmware versions used in Shure devices.\nIf packets are lost or delayed, QOS may not be not configured correctly. Verify audio traffic is in a dedicated queue with the second highest priority, including on trunk and LAG interfaces. Also verify that there are no 100 Mbps switches or trunk ports on the network. Ensure uplinks are not saturated.\nAES67 streams are announced via SAP on multicast group 239.255.255.255:9875 Verify all devices are subscribed to this group.\nIf devices cannot subscribe to Dante Multicast flows or AES67 flows,  this means that all devices are not able to join the AES67 group. Check multicast group membership for that group. Recreating the AES67 flow in Dante Controller may help."}, {"question": "I have a Shure wireless system and it is not loud enough. I have to hold the mic very close to my mouth and speak loudly. I can also hear audio if I scratch the mic grill. Do I need a different mic element?", "answer": "Answer\nThe problem is not the mic element. The problem is a level mis-match between the wireless receiver output and the device to which it is connected. This scenario is common and the explanation is simple.\n\nThe audio output level of many wireless mic systems is \"Mic level\". This means the output level is the equivalent of a wired microphone, like a Shure SM58. A typical Mic level output is 1 to 3 millivolts (mV). This Mic level signal cannot properly drive an input that requires Aux level (100 mV), or Line level (1,000 mV or 1 V). When you speak loudly into the mic and hold it close to your mouth, the audio output level increases dramatically, and the system then works as expected.\n\nThe options are:\nConnect the wireless receiver into a Mic level input of the following device.  If the device has a selectable input, make certain the input is set to Mic level. If there is an input gain control, set it to Maximum.  If there is an input attenuator control, set it to Minimum/No Attenuation.\nIf there is no Mic level input, connect the wireless receiver output into a Shure SCM268 or SCM262 mixer. The mixer will increase the audio level from Mic level to Aux level or to Line level. In place of the Shure mixer, use a device like the Radio Design Labs FP-MP1 Microphone Preamp.\nHelpful hint #1: A Mic level input is typically a female XLR connector. An Aux level or Line level input is typically an RCA jack, 1/4\" phone jack, or 3.5 mm phone jack. Please note that just because one connector mates properly with another does NOT mean that the levels match.\n\nWhat do typical audio connectors look like?\n\nHelpful hint #2: Substitute a wired mic, like a Shure SM58, for the wireless receiver. If the SM58 has the same \"low output\" complaint as above, then the device input is definitely Aux level or Line level.\n\nHelpful hint #3: Different wireless receivers have different output levels. This is true within the Shure line and with competitive brands. Consult the User Guide of each wireless receiver to determine its output signal level. Mic Level can vary as much as 20 dB between different receivers. On certain Shure receivers, the audio output level is 14 dB greater using the 1/4\" phone jack compared to the XLR.  Some wireless receivers have a Line / Mic switch near the XLR output.  Selecting Line will boost the output signal level significantly.\n\nHelpful hint #4:  The mic-to-mouth distance is a critical element of loudness. A lapel microphone, positioned on the chest, will never be as loud as a handheld microphone, positioned close to the mouth.  A lapel microphone, held close to the mouth, can be as loud as the handheld microphone.

Can you help?", "answer": "Answer\nPoint to Point Wireless Audio Systems\n\nIntroduction\n\nOften it is desirable (or even mandatory) to send an audio signal from one fixed location to another fixed location without wires. This is termed \"point-to-point\" wireless. In some cases this may involve a single transmit location and multiple receive locations, referred to as \"point-to-multi-point\" wireless. Possible applications include remote speaker/amplifier locations, remote recording/broadcast operations, and one-way communication links. Potentially this could be accomplished either by optical transmission or by radio frequency transmission.\n\nOptical methods are inherently limited to line-of-sight conditions. The use of conventional (non-directional) infrared transmission is limited by ambient light levels vs. practical infrared power levels. Modulated laser transmission (highly directional) is another optical possibility but available systems are primarily geared to high-speed data/video transmission and are not widely (or affordably) distributed.\n\nLow-power radio transmission systems, on the other hand, are both widely available and relatively affordable. For radio signals, line-of-sight conditions are desirable but they are not strictly required. In addition, point-to-multi-point is more easily accomplished with a single radio transmitter.\n\nGeneral requirements for point-to-point wireless include:\nHigh fidelity audio\nLine level in and line level out\nAC-power capability for both transmitter and receiver\n\"Sufficient\" transmission distance\nMost radio communication products such as wireless intercoms, two-way radios, and mobile phones are unsuitable due to lack of audio fidelity. However, two common high-fidelity radio products that can be used in a point-to-point application are the wireless microphone system and the wireless in-ear monitor system. Each of these has slightly different concerns/advantages in performance and in setup.\n\nUsing Shure wireless microphones for point-to-point\n\nA bodypack wireless system can fulfill the requirements above with two modifications. First, though many receivers have line level outputs, few transmitters are capable of accepting a line level input signal. This can be accomplished by using an external pad or attenuator at the transmitter input. Second, though most receivers run on AC power, transmitters are battery-only devices. Using a suitable external DC power supply can provide the necessary AC capability for the transmitter.\n\nDepending on the input signal, two off-the-shelf attenuator solutions exist for Shure bodypack transmitters equipped with TA4 input connectors. A balanced, +4dBu source can be accommodated by using a Shure A15LA (-50dB, XLR-to-XLR, in-line attenuator) in combination with a Shure WA310 (XLR-to-TA4F adapter cable).\nAn unbalanced, -10dBV source can be accommodated by using an RCA to 1/4\" female phone jack cable in combination with a Shure WA302 (1/4\u201d phone-to-TA4F adapter cable). \n\nMost Shure bodypacks operate on a pair of AA batteries (3vdc total). Shure bodypacks that use the SB900A battery, can also use the SBC-DC battery eliminator.\n\nOnce the input signal is sufficiently attenuated and power is provided, the bodypack transmitter should be located to provide the best line-of-sight to the receiver. This usually involves securing the pack to a pole or some other elevated structure. If wet weather is a factor, the transmitter can be protected by a \"ziplock\" bag or other covering.\n\nAt the receiver, no modification is usually required since it is AC powered and has a line level output.\n\nAntennas\n\nThe antennas supplied with all Shure wireless products are omnidirectional. These are suitable for both point-to-point and point-to-multi-point applications. If additional transmission range is required it may be possible to use directional receiving and/or transmitting antenna(s). Note that although diversity receivers are always preferred it may not be necessary (or practical) to use directional antennas on both antenna inputs for point-to-point. Since the transmitter and receiver locations are assumed to be fixed in this application, multipath variations should be minimal once the equipment is set up.\n\nThe UA874 powered directional antenna can be used with the receiver directly.\n\nMaximum range of point-to-point wireless\n\nThe practical range for most of these systems in point-to-point applications is comparable to their published range in normal usage. For standard wireless systems this ranges from about 150 ft. to 800 ft. depending on various conditions. Directional antennas may boost these ranges by 50%. Good line of sight and the normal precautions for frequency selection are assumed.\n\nIf greater distances are required, it can be accomplished by using an additional system as \"repeater.\" That is, at the location of the first receiver a second transmitter is set up to rebroadcast the signal to a more distant second receiver. Of course, each of these additional systems has to be on a different compatible frequency. The practical limit for a repeater system using standard wireless equipment is about 3 \"hops\" due to increased noise and distortion.\n\nSummary\n\nIt is possible to employ Shure wireless systems for point-to-point applications in several ways. Both wireless microphone systems and PSM systems can be used, each with different adaptations. The modifications are primarily for AC powering of battery powered devices and for matching audio signal levels. Special connectors and/or adapters may also be necessary in some cases.\n\nFor moderate distance, single channel applications use wireless microphone systems for good results. Multi-channel, especially stereo, transmission may benefit from the PSM approach. Longer distance uses will require directional antennas for wireless microphone receivers or for PSM transmitters. Maximum range applications can be handled by the dual directional antenna PSM setup or by using multiple systems in a repeater configuration.\n\nSources\n\nWinegard\n(319) 754-0600"}, {"question": "When I place the Shure SB900 battery pack into the SBC800-US charger, there is a yellow LED that blinks. What does this mean?", "answer": "Answer\nThe blinking yellow LED indicates that the SB900 battery has been placed in the charger incorrectly. The battery is positioned \"backwards.\" That is, the label is still facing up but the orientation has been reversed for the positive and negative ends.\n\nThe SB900 battery can be inserted into the SBC800 tray charger or the SBC200 docking charger in reverse orientation. Although the SB900 will not snap into place with the usual reassuring \"thunk\", it will fit and will make contact with the at least some of the charging contacts. Depending on how firmly the SB900 is fitted into the charger, it will either display a blinking yellow LED immediately or it will display a red LED (charging) for 10-20 seconds after which time the red LED will go out and the blinking yellow LED will illuminate.\n\nThe SBC200 charger can detect when the SBC900 battery is reversed in the transmitter. It is feasible to insert the SB900 battery, in reverse orientation, into the ULXD handheld transmitter or ULXD bodypack transmitter. If either transmitter is then placed into the SBC200, the corresponding red LED will illuminate for 10-20 seconds after which time the red LED will go out and a blinking yellow LED will illuminate. \n\nNote: the red and green LED's only appear to operate in a non-blinking mode. When the battery is in the \"0-90%\" condition, the red LED is solid. When the battery is in the \"90-99%\" condition, both the green and red LED's are solid. Finally, when the battery is in the \"99-100%\" condition, the green LED is solid and the red LED is dark.\n\nThe blinking yellow light can also indicate a problem with an individual SB900 battery. The charger will display the same error when the affected battery is inserted in a different bay. A wireless transmitter also will display an error message when used with a malfunctioning battery."}, {"question": "I have an old 55S microphone that doesn't work anymore.

Can you direct me to a chart for using them? There's only alkaline and the Shure rechargeable battery pack listed in the user guide.", "answer": "Answer\nNote that posting a specific chart and having it be accurate is difficult with NiMH batteries since the battery life per charge can change over the life of a given battery. Unlike Alkaline batteries which is a one-shot use and are loser in tolerance when using name brands, there are hundreds of types of NiMH batteries and they tend to not be consistent.\n\nDifferent NiMH cells were tested and an average was compiled to use for the metering. Here's what was found in testing:\n\n1 or 10 mW settings:\nFULL Bars = 11.2 to 14 hours (battery at approx.100%)\n4 bars = 7 to 11.2 hours\n3 bars = 2.8 to 7 hours\n2 bars = 1.4 to 2.8 hours\n1 bar = 20 min to 1.4 hours\nWarning bar comes between 20 minutes and 0 minutes remaining (approx. 5% of battery life)\n\n20 mW setting:\nFULL bars = 7.6 to 9 hours\n4 bars = 5.25 to 7.6 hours\n3 bars =- 2.1 to 5.25 hours\n2 bars = 1 to 2.1 hours\n1 bar = 15 min to 1 hour\nWarning bar comes on between 15 minutes and 0 minutes remaining (approx. 5%of battery life)\n\nThere is a wide range time-wise right in the middle of the battery life range likely due to the wide variation of the different batteries tested. Because an average was used, it is also not possible to really correlate a specific voltage.\n\nIf NiMH cells are already owned must be employed, these test values may be useful. However, we recommend using the Shure SB-900 Lithium ION batteries. These are more consistent, do not suffer from memory-effect, have a very long life cycle (at least 500 cycles to 80% health), offer about the same or higher life per charge, and offer more accurate battery life metering that is displayed in Hours and Minutes instead of bars. The initial investment in these batteries and chargers is substantial, but the performance and life of the batteries should make up for the cost over the life of the system."}, {"question": "I'm looking for a mic that fits inside a Clasical guitar that will pick up the Nylon strings nicely for recording. Do you have any products of that sort under $200?", "answer": "Answer\nBefore you make any buying decision, please read the following:\n\nMICROPHONE TECHNIQUE FOR THE CLASSICAL GUITAR\nby Michael Pettersen\nDirector of Applications Engineering - Shure Inc.\n\nMiking a classical guitar for recording or amplification is a mystery to most players. This article briefly explains microphone selection and placement as both influence the sound of your recorded or amplified guitar.\n\nA guitar radiates a different timbre in every direction and each guitar surface produces a distinct timbre. By adjusting the mic position relative to the guitar, tonal balance can be dramatically altered. A guitar is designed to sound best at a distance, i.e. two or more feet away. It is \"at a distance\" that the numerous sounds radiating from the guitar surfaces combine into a pleasing composite. A microphone placed \"at a distance\" tends to pick up a well-balanced tone quality. In contrast, a mic placed very close to the guitar tends to emphasize the surface that the microphone is near. Therefore, the sound from a closely placed mic will not be representative of the guitar as a whole. Keeping this in mind, here are fundamentals to observe when miking a guitar:\n\nUse a condenser unidirectional microphone with a flat (neutral) frequency response. Suggested Shure models are the KSM137, KSM44, KSM32, SM27, SM81.\n\nA unidirectional mic boosts the bass progressively as it is placed closer to the guitar. This is proximity effect. When miking less than one foot away, be aware of this effect. Recording-quality mics, like the Shure SM81, often have a switch to reduce the bass.\n\nFor initial mic positioning, close one ear with a finger while someone plays your guitar. Listen with your other ear. Move around until you find a spot that sounds good. Put the mic there. Placing the microphone close will reduce the pick up of room acoustics and background noise. This can be important if recording in a less than ideal lo-cation. But miking too close will color the guitar's timbre.\n\nMy favorite miking position for recording is: Place the mic next to your right ear. Aim the mic downward toward the guitar bridge. With my guitar, this position sounds very natural and well-balanced.\n\nWhen amplifying your guitar, you may encounter feedback. In these cases, position the mic very close to the loudest part of the guitar. Then experiment with mic choice, speaker location, and equalization to obtain your desired tonal balance and sound level.\n\nRemember that a difference of only one inch can make a tremendous difference in what the mic picks up. There is no one perfect way to mike a guitar as there is no single ideal mic to use. Like playing, it is part science and part art. Choose and place the mic to get the sound you want. Experiment and listen!\n\nIf after reading this article, you still want to place a mic inside of the guitar, we suggest you audition the Shure SM93 and the Shure MX183."}, {"question": "How do I configure Microflex Wireless equipment?

Any balanced dynamic microphone, such as the 55SH, will not be damaged by phantom power."}, {"question": "What are some tips, techniques, and mic selections for barbershop quartets?", "answer": "Answer\nThe following is an excerpt from an article by the Barbershop Harmony Society.\n  SPEBSQSA Microphone and Sound System Guidelines, Written by Glen Glancy and Bill Lightner, Edited by Doug Maddox, October 22,1999. This document establishes a common source of microphone and sound system guidelines for the members of the Society. We recommend small diaphragm cardioid condenser microphones, which are suitable for use with both quartets and choruses. We do not recommend large diaphragm condenser microphones \u2013 the choice for vocal recording \u2013 for SPEBSQSA events. When floor monitor speakers are used at the singing position, the typical loss of pattern control at low frequencies in these microphones results in feedback. In simple terminology, the monitors cannot be loud enough to be of benefit to the performers before the sound from the monitors is picked up by the microphones and re-amplified, causing what is known as feedback. Small diaphragm microphones provide better low frequency pattern control and therefore can be used successfully with floor monitor speakers.\n\nQuartet Microphone Setup\nA pair of the same microphones should be mounted to a single mic stand using a device called a \u201cstereo bar.\u201d A stereo bar is a simple flat bar that attaches at the center of a standard mic stand and has a slug at each end for attaching a standard mic clip to the bar. Microphones attached in such a manner can then be aimed by adjusting the clips to point the capsules in relationship to the performers.\n\nChoosing a Mic Stand\nIf the stage is a permanent one, we recommend an Atlas Soundolier MS25 stand with a boom attachment. This is a heavy-duty stand with a tripod-shaped heavyweight cast iron base. It is capable of supporting the microphones on a boom without additional weights to hold the stand in place. The boom attachment places the vertical portion of the stand out of the way of hand gestures by the performers. Straw hats, canes, and other props have a knack for finding their way against a mic stand. If the stage is a temporary one, we recommend an Atlas Soundolier BS36 stand placed on the solid floor in front of the stage, weighted if necessary, and extended to place the microphones on a boom at stage height. You have seen this method used for the past several years at Internationals. It keeps the stage noises caused by performer movement from being picked up mechanically through the stand.\n\nAligning the Microphones\nThe microphones should be at mid-chest height for a \"standard\" six-foot barbershop singer or higher. The microphones should be adjusted so the capsules are at the same point in space, perfectly aligned vertically with one atop the other, and as close as possible without the microphone bodies touching each other. Since you can actually see the capsules on most of the microphones we recommend, this should be easily accomplished before placing the windscreens on the mics. When viewed from the top, looking down at the mics, the capsules should create a pickup radius of about 180 degrees horizontally. So, if you begin with the capsules 90 degrees to each other and increase that angle by moving the capsules another 15 degrees each, you should be close to correct. The capsules should appear to crossfire and aim at quartet singing positions one and four. Only mic tests, which are described later, will confirm the accuracy of the alignment.\n\nMarking the Toe-Line Radius\nThe next essential step \u2013 critical in competition but proper for shows as well \u2013 is to mark a standard radius on the floor that the performers are not allowed to cross. This \"toe-line\" radius should be approximately 36 inches from the center point of the microphone setup. Mark the floor with white tape or some other highly visible method that the performers will be able to see even with stage lights in their eyes.\n\nPlacing the Floor Monitor Speakers\nFloor monitor speakers should be placed behind the microphones, between the lip of the stage and the rear of the microphone arrangement. Place the speakers as close to the vertical mic stand as possible, angled out to face the performers. One speaker should serve performers one and two, and the other should serve performers three and four. The speakers should project sound toward the least sensitive area of the microphone pattern. With cardioid microphones, the least sensitive area is the backside of the capsule; therefore, you would aim the speakers at the tail of those microphones. Slight adjustments may be necessary to find the best sound gain before feedback, but generally this location will serve the needs of the performers. Adjustment of monitor EQ will be necessary to maximize available gain before feedback.\n\nTesting the Microphones\nThe off-axis pattern variations of the microphones are sufficiently different to require the following steps, although the setup may appear to match the preceding instructions. Perform the following steps to test the microphones:\nA single person, a talker, should alternately stand at quartet singing positions one and four, speaking directly on axis to each of the microphones, while the sound system operator adjusts the signal levels to match when heard in the house speakers. An appointed listener should be in the house to confirm this matching process.\nThe talker should stand exactly between the microphones and, while speaking, move his head within a one-foot side-to-side distance to assure that no coloration of the sound occurs between the pickup of the two microphones. This sound variation is caused by \u201cphasing,\u201d which is a time domain problem between the two capsules. To fix a phasing problem, move one microphone along its own axis, in towards the other microphone or out away from the other microphone, until no \u201cseam\u201d in the coverage area can be discerned. It is important to retain the angle of the capsules to each other and move only the relationship of the capsules in the horizontal plane. The mechanical center between two microphones and the acoustical center between them may not be the same due to the physical makeup and construction of the particular microphone model. This is a result of construction techniques employed to tune the pickup pattern to the manufacturer1s design criteria.\nConfirm that this pair of microphones picks up all four voices with equal level. The talker should speak into the mics while moving around the toe line through the four singing positions. The listener should perceive no apparent level difference for those four positions. To verify the mic levels\nIf the two outside singers appear to be louder than the two center singers, reduce the angle of the mics from the 110-120 degree setup to a setup closer to 90 degrees.\nIf the center singers are too loud, increase the angle of the mics beyond the 120- degree point.\nThis is a subtle adjustment. A couple of degrees will make a difference. Be sure to re-check the center pickup point if you have to make this change. Proper setup and testing will result in a microphone arrangement that will provide an accurate and sonically awesome representation of the quartet's barbershop sound that will both interface with a mono sound reinforcement system and also provide an excellent stereo pickup for recording.\n\n\nA superb document!

It does not happen onstage. It only happens when I go out into the audience to play. It gets worse as I get farther from the stage.", "answer": "Answer\nIt is not the wireless guitar system. It is the laws of physics causing the delay.\n\nThe signal from the wireless transmitter travels to the wireless receiver at nearly the speed of light: 186,282 miles per second or 1,084,161,240 feet per second. The average human perceives delay in an audio signal when the original sound is delayed by 0.05 second or more. For there to be a perceiveable audio delay from the wireless transmission, you would have to be 9,314 miles from the stage. Highly unlikely.\n\nBut sound travels much slower than light. The speed of sound is about 1,100 feet per second. In 0.05 second, a sound wave travels about 55 feet. So if you are 55 feet from the main PA loudspeakers, you may perceive a delay. A guitarist may be even more sensitive to acoustic delay because he can perceive the difference between when a string was picked and when the sound was heard.\n\nHere is another way to look at this situation. An audience member that is 55 feet from the stage will hear your guitar delayed by 0.05 second because that is the time that the sound wave takes to travel from the stage to the audience member's ear. Place yourself next to that audience member and you will hear your guitar delayed by 0.05 second...even if you use a 55 foot long cable in place of the Shure wireless system."}, {"question": "How do theater professionals use and hide wireless bodypack transmitters?", "answer": "Answer\nMost bodypacks come with an attached belt clip. The obvious way to wear a bodypack transmitter is to clip the bodypack onto an actor\u2019s clothing at the beltline or on the hip area. The transmitter can also fit into pockets of shirts, jackets, or pants with little hassle. Even so, it is important to allow the antenna to be unobstructed and fully extended.\nExtra pockets of fabric can be sewn into costuming when the bodypack needs to be as unobtrusive as possible without using the clip.\nThe small of the back can be used for placement if a fanny pack or similar harness is used instead of the clip. Make sure the antenna is able to extend.\nA bodypack can be held between the shoulder blades and under costuming using a shoulder harness or \"back pack\" made up of a pouch for the pack and a couple of loops to go around the shoulders.\nMaintaining stability in some odd locations can require the use of cloth, elastic, or Velcro straps or bands. They should be stable enough to hold bodypacks on to arms and thighs.\nAffixing a large safety pin to a bodypack with gaffers tape can allow smaller, lighter bodypacks to be affixed to hats or wigs, although this may not be the best choice for physically active performances or dancing.\nRF signal can be blocked and reflected by metallic surfaces. This can include any costuming that has metal threading or metal plating, the extreme cases being your knight in shining armor. Wearing a bodypack under this material will severely degrade RF performance.\nAntennas of bodypacks should always be kept as clear as possible from obstructive surfaces or materials. As stated earlier, antennas should never be curled up, stuffed into pockets, or wrapped around the transmitter.\nAllow for strain relief on the microphone connector and antenna, so that movement of the actor will not crimp the cable or antenna with their movements. Repetitive strain on the cable will cause failure sooner rather than later. Remember to check cables and antennas thoroughly before each performance.\nYou can utilize the lock out features of some bodypacks to make sure the actor cannot accidentally power off the transmitter during a performance, or in the case of frequency agile systems, accidentally change the operating frequency.\nMake sure to leave the battery as accessible as possible, as you may need to do a quick change unexpectedly.\nThe human body, because of its composition, can cause some RF transmission issues with bodypack transmitters. In certain cases, the body of the actor can potentially inhibit RF transmission. Repositioning the bodypack or the receiving antennas (or both) can overcome this occurrence.\nSweat can be potentially harmful to the electronics of a bodypack transmitter. There are many methods sound designers have created to protect bodypacks from sweat. A simple solution is to wear a Neoprene transmitter pouch when feasible. While not completely waterproof, it will protect the bodypack from sweat and low level moisture. Another more protective method is to use a dry condom to cover the bodypack. As unusual as it sounds, it is fairly effective when used properly. An un-powdered, dry surgical glove can also be used. Remember that there are people allergic to latex or other materials, so check with the talent ahead of time before using any method of covering a bodypack next to skin.\nIt is a good idea to clearly label your bodypacks in some manner to identify the intended user. Any mix-ups can destroy the continuity of the show and cause the sound engineer to search for the right mixer channel to operate during the show.\nDo not leave transmitters bunched together on a table or in a bin while they are turned on. The proximity of the transmitters to each other can increase the likelihood of intermodulation distortion (IMD) manifesting itself on one or more receivers. The same effects can occur when poorly chosen frequencies are used on bodypacks that are very close to each other on stage. Proper selection of frequencies is a must.\nBodypacks can come equipped with a variety of input connectors, depending on the manufacturer. Most will supply bias voltage for condenser elements. Using one manufacturer\u2019s wireless lavalier microphone with another manufacturer\u2019s transmitter and receiver is not out of the question. It is a matter of contacting the manufacturer of either and getting the proper \"pin outs\" of the connector types. It may require purchasing a mic with no connector, or rewiring the proper connector on to the lavalier in the right manner. Do not assume the mic will work because that if the connector is the same between manufacturers. There are several ways of wiring any given connector.\nWhen using bodypack transmitters simultaneously with wireless in-ear monitor receivers, make sure the packs are separated as much as possible to avoid any RF interaction between the two. The methods used for concealing bodypack transmitters can also be used for wireless in-ear monitor receivers, as they are the same general shape and size."}, {"question": "How do I fix a GLX-D Firmware update that failed?", "answer": "Answer\nIt is possible that the firmware update for a GLXD transmitter or receiver can fail due to a \"corrupt device.\" The process listed below should resolve this.\n\nExample error message:\n\n\"Failed to install primary firmware 2.0.0.1 to GLX-RXPedal-54134036-WRU Device is on golden FPGA, please call support\"\n\n\n\nTo correct this issue you will need to:\nConnect GLXD component to computer via USB\nPower off GLXD component (if not already off)\nOpen Shure Update Utility\nHold down link button and turn GLXD component on.\nUnit reboots\nUpdate utility will then recognize GLXD as a corrupt device and give you the option to repair it:\nClick on repair corrupt device button\nShure Update Utility will recognize the GLXD unit\nSelect the GLXD component and perform update again"}, {"question": "What type of audio recording file is created by the ShurePlus Motiv app?", "answer": "Answer\nThe Shure Plus Motiv app records only WAV files: 44.1kHz/16 bit or 48kHz/24 bit. \n\nAfter the recording is finished, the WAV file can then be converted using \"Save As\" and it will become one of these compressed formats:\nALAC - Apple Lossless Audio Codec\nAAC 96kbs - Advanced Audio Coding\nAAC 128kbs - Advanced Audio Coding\nAAC 256kbs - Advanced Audio Coding\n\nWith the MV88, a stereo file is recorded even when the mic is set to the \"Mono Cardioid\" mode.

What is its function? I would like to solder an XLR directly onto the cable from the mic and connect it to a mixer with phantom power.", "answer": "Answer\nA condenser microphone preamp is part of the complete microphone design, not an optional accessory. The only reason a condenser mic model is available without the preamp is for use with a wireless transmitter. In that case, the microphone element is powered from bias voltage provided by the transmitter.  Phantom power applied directly to the microphone element will damage it.\n\nThe preamp takes the signal from the mic element, which is medium impedance and unbalanced, and converts it to a low impedance, balanced signal - suitable for connection to standard professional XLR microphone inputs with phantom power.  The preamp also converts phantom power to bias power to operate the mic element.\n\nAll condenser microphones have a preamp; this includes headworn condenser mics and lavalier condenser mics.  With handheld condenser microphones and studio condenser microphones the preamp is not as obvious, because the preamp circuity is contained within the mic handle/housing.\n\n\"Preamp\" is perhaps not the best term to use, as rarely is signal amplification a function of this type of device.

How do I do it?", "answer": "Answer\nTheater Sound: The Science Behind the Illusion\n\nHave you ever noticed how great Broadway shows sound? Does the rock band in \"Rent\" get your blood pumping? Do the lyrics to \"Memories\" get you choked up every time? Are you ready to run to the local music store and spend a few hundred dollars on some overhead microphones so your local theater (or grade school, high school, church production, etc.) can get that incredible clarity and power? Well, hang on just a minute. Before you run out to spend those hard-earned tax dollars, let\u2019s take a quick look at the realities of theater sound, and what you can realistically expect from your venue.\n\nMicrophones for everybody!\n\nMost theaters that operate on a limited budget try to use as few microphones as possible. Common techniques include hanging a few microphones overhead, and maybe a few boundary (or surface mount) microphones at the front of the stage. There are many inherent problems with these techniques, including, but not limited to:\nReduced gain before feedback due to too many open microphones too far away from the actors.\nComb filtering (that thin, hollow sound) resulting from multiple microphones picking up the same actor.\nIncreased pickup of stage vibration noise, reverberation, and other unwanted sounds.\nVarying sound levels as actors move in and out of the pick-up areas of different microphones.\nHow do professional theaters deal with these issues? Easy - they don\u2019t. Every performer on stage gets a wireless microphone. Most Broadway productions use over a hundred thousand dollars worth of wireless microphones for a single show. A basic rule of microphone technique for any application is get the microphone as close as possible to the desired sound source. Therefore, even though you can\u2019t always see it, each actor has a small lavalier microphone clipped, taped, glued, or sewn to some part of the face, hair, or costume. Having every actor \u201cclose-miked\u201d eliminates all of the above problems encountered with distant miking. The distance between the microphone and the actor\u2019s mouth remains constant, thus providing a constant output level. High sound level shows such as \u201cRent\u201d go a step further, using headset microphones to get the microphone even closer to the sound source.\n\nThe Overhead Dilemma\n\nOkay, so your budget doesn\u2019t quite get up to Broadway standards. Using a few overhead microphones for smaller speaking parts can be an acceptable alternative, but be realistic about what to expect. Consider the following example: Two actors on stage, one is wearing a lavalier microphone six inches from his mouth, the other is standing six feet from the nearest overhead microphone. The actor wearing the lavalier will be 21 dB louder than the other actor will. Realistically, a 21dB difference will sound four times as loud!\n\nTurning the microphones up louder is not always an option, either. For any given sound system, the farther the microphones are from the sound source, and the closer they are to the loudspeakers, the less you can turn them up before feedback occurs. Multiple open microphones will further increase the chances for feedback. In addition, distant microphones will pick up more ambient sound, making the actors sound farther away, when compared to close-miked actors. If you choose to use overhead microphones, pay close attention to where the actors are standing when they speak. If the actors are always as close to the microphones as possible, sound quality will improve. Turning down unused microphones will also help.\n\nFor downstage areas, or runways where it is not practical to hang an overhead microphone, boundary microphones are often used. These small, flat microphones are usually placed at the edge of stage, where they will be out of the actors way. Boundary microphones are not magic; they are subject to the same limitations as overhead microphones, with the additional issue of stage vibration pick-up.\n\nOverhead and boundary microphones that you may see in a Broadway production are not necessarily used for sound reinforcement, either. Many times they are used for hearing assist, backstage cues, or recording.\n\nOne final note on microphones: shotgun microphones are never used for sound reinforcement! The shotgun microphone was designed for film and video production work, where the microphone signals are going straight to tape. It does not \"focus\" on the sound coming from the stage, nor does it filter out unwanted sounds. A shotgun placed at the back of the hall will pick up everything that happens between the microphone and the stage.\n\nAcoustics\n\nAnother issue that can plague amateur theater is poor acoustics. The typical \u201ccafe-gymna-torium\u201d that is used for many school and church theatrical productions is, acoustically speaking, the worst possible place for sound reinforcement. These rooms tend to be extremely \"echo-y\", which limits intelligibility (the ability to understand what is being said) and decreases gain before feedback (how loud you can turn up the sound system).\n\nProfessional productions are done in quiet, non-reflective, controlled environments that are optimized for theater sound. Many theaters also employ a distributed sound system, which uses many speakers placed throughout the venue that are divided into \u201czones\u201d. Each zone is fed a varying amount of signal, depending on how far they are from the stage. Loudspeakers nearest the stage get very little, if any, signal, while those at the back get proportionally more. This also allows the overall volume level to be lower, which improves intelligibility in a poor acoustic environment.\n\nKnow your performers!\n\nLastly, remember to keep in mind the skill level of the performers involved. Professional actors and singers know how to project their voice, which creates more signal level at the microphone. Children, especially shy ones, do not make much sound, which further necessitates close-miking techniques. As mentioned above, turning distant microphones up louder will most likely result in feedback. Remember, if you can\u2019t hear what the actors are saying from six feet away, the microphone certainly can\u2019t either!\n\nIf the above examples seem to paint a grim picture, don\u2019t despair. Placing the microphones as close as possible to the actors mouths will always result in improved sound quality. Just be aware that overhead microphones, used carefully, can increase intelligibility for smaller speaking roles. What they cannot do, however, is create a Broadway-like experience. Wireless microphones and carefully controlled, expensive sound systems operated by top-flight sound technicians are the science behind the illusion in professional theater."}, {"question": "In the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, the SM58 and SM57 (among other models) had a threaded hole near the male XLR connector.

It has better fidelity for music.\nBottom line:  SM35 should sound better for vocals."}, {"question": "What is intermodulation?", "answer": "Answer\nThis is a excerpt from Selection and Operation of Wireless Microphones.\n\nFrequency Selection\n\nSelecting the operating frequency of a wireless audio system is a two-step process: first, choose an appropriate radio frequency band; second, choose the appropriate operating frequency (or frequencies) within that band. There is a finite number of wireless microphone systems that may be used simultaneously in any one frequency range. The reasons for this limitation are several and they fall under the general topic of frequency coordination or \"compatibility.\" We will define these factors and examine each in terms of origin, effects, and relative importance to total system compatibility. In the first section we will consider only interactions that may occur between the individual wireless microphone systems themselves.\n\nAt this point it should be stated that frequency coordination is a process that must take into account various factors including the physical (limitations), the mathematical (calculations) and the political (regulations). It is not necessary for most users to go through the details of this process. Wireless manufacturers provide this service through pre-selected frequency groups and can also offer assistance in complex applications using proprietary computer programs. What follows here is an introduction to the process for the interested user.\n\nSystem Compatibility\n\nThe two main areas of concern are: interaction between transmitters and receivers related to their operating frequencies, and interactions between transmitters and receivers related to their internal frequencies. The first class of interactions is the more important one and may occur in any group of wireless microphone systems. It is also the one more cumbersome to calculate. The second class of interactions is less problematic and is also relatively easy to predict. However, it is determined by specific system characteristics.\n\nOperating Frequency Interactions: Intermodulation\n\nA single wireless microphone system can theoretically be used on any open operating frequency. When a second system is added it must be on a different operating frequency in order to be used at the same time as the first. This limitation arises from the nature of radio receivers: they cannot properly demodulate more than one signal on the same frequency. In other words, it is not possible for a receiver to \"mix\" the signals from multiple transmitters. If one signal is substantially stronger than the others it will \"capture\" the receiver and block out the other signals. If the signals are of comparable strength none of them will be received clearly.\n\nThe effect of this is often heard in automobile radios when travelling out of range of one station and into the range of another station at the same frequency. The receiver will switch back and forth between the two stations as their relative signal strength changes, often with considerable noise and distortion. The result is that neither station is listenable when the signals are nearly equal.\n\nIf the wireless microphone systems must be on different frequencies, how \"different\" should they be? The limiting characteristic of the receiver in this regard is its \"selectivity\" or its ability to differentiate between adjacent frequencies. The greater the selectivity the closer together the operating frequencies can be. The recommended minimum frequency difference ranges from 300kHz to 1.5 MHz, depending on receiver selectivity.\n\nWhen a third system is added to the group it must be at least the recommended frequency difference from each of the existing systems. However, it is now necessary to consider other potential interactions between the transmitters to insure that all three systems will be compatible with each other. The most important type of interaction is called intermodulation (IM), and it arises when signals are applied to \"non-linear\" circuits. (See Figure 3-4.)\n  A characteristic of a non-linear circuit is that its output contains \"new\" signals in addition to the original signals that were applied to the circuit. These additional signals are called IM products and are produced within the circuit components themselves. The frequencies of IM products are mathematically related to the original transmitter frequencies. Specifically, they consist of sums and differences of the original frequencies, multiples of the original frequencies, and sums and differences of the multiples. Non-linear circuits are intrinsic to the design of wireless components and include the output stages of transmitters and the input stages of receivers. The \"mixer\" stage at the receiver input is an example of a non-linear circuit: recall that it is designed to produce a \"difference\" frequency that becomes the intermediate frequency (IF) for subsequent stages.\n\nIM can occur when transmitters are in close proximity to each other. The signal from each transmitter generates IM products in the output stage of the other. These new signals are transmitted along with the original signals and can be picked up by receivers operating at the corresponding IM frequencies. (See Figure 3-7.)\n  IM can also occur when transmitters are operated very close to receivers. In this case IM products are generated in the receiver input stage which can interfere with the desired signal or be detected by the receiver if the desired signal (transmitter) is not present.\n\nThe strongest IM products are the two so-called 3rd order products produced by two adjacent transmitters operating at frequency f1 and frequency f2, where f1 is lower than f2. The resulting IM products may be calculated as:\n\n          IM1 = (2 x f1) \u2013 f2\n\n          IM2 = (2 x f2) \u2013 f1\n\nIf the interval between f1 and f2 is F, then IM1 = f1 \u2013 F and IM2 = f2 + F. That is, one IM will appear exactly at interval F above the upper frequency f2 while the other IM will appear exactly at interval F below the lower frequency. For example, if f1 = 180MHz and f2 = 190MHz, then F = 10MHz. Thus, IM1 = 170MHz and IM2 = 200MHz. (See Figure 3-5.)\n    In addition to IM products generated by interaction between two transmitters, other IM products are generated by interaction between three transmitters in a similar fashion. (See Figure 3-6.) In order to avoid potential IM problems most manufacturers recommend a minimum margin of 250 kHz (0.25 MHz) between any 3rd order IM product and any operating frequency. This further restricts available frequency choices as the number of simultaneous systems increases.\n    It should be apparent from this discussion that the prediction of potential compatibility problems due to IM products is best left to computer programs. The complexity increases exponentially for additional systems: a group of 10 wireless microphone systems involves thousands of calculations.\n\nInternal frequency Interactions: LO, IF, Crystal Multipliers\n\nIn addition to frequency conflicts due to intermodulation between operating frequencies there are certain other sources of potential conflicts due to the various \"internal\" frequencies present in the normal operation of transmitters and receivers. These differ from manufacturer to manufacturer and even from system to system from the same manufacturer.\n\nOne such source is the local oscillator (LO) of the receiver itself. Although this is a low-level signal which is generally confined within the receiver, it is possible for the local oscillator of one receiver to be picked up by another receiver tuned to that LO frequency if they or their antennas are in close proximity to each other (stacked, for instance). For example, assuming a typical intermediate frequency (IF) of 10.7 MHz, a receiver tuned to 200.7 MHz would have its LO operating at 190.0 MHz. Another receiver tuned to 190 MHz should not be used close to the first receiver because the second unit could pick up the LO of the first, especially if the 190 MHz transmitter is turned off or is operating at a great distance. (See Figure 3-8.) Good design and shielding in receivers and physical separation of receivers will minimize the possibility of LO interference. For multiple units, active antenna splitters will effectively isolate antenna inputs from each other. However, it is still recommended that operating frequencies be chosen to avoid LO frequencies by at least 250 KHz.\n    An \"image\" frequency is another source of possible interference. In a receiver, recall that the frequency of the local oscillator (LO) always differs from the frequency of the received signal by an amount equal to the intermediate frequency (IF). Specifically, the operating frequency is above the local oscillator frequency by an interval equal to the IF. When these two frequencies are applied to the mixer section (a non-linear circuit) one of the output frequencies of the mixer is this difference frequency (the IF), which is the tuned frequency of the subsequent IF stage filters.\n\nIf the frequency of a second signal is at the same interval below the local oscillator frequency, the difference between this second frequency and the LO frequency would again be equal to the intermediate frequency (IF). The mixer stage does not discriminate between \"positive\" or \"negative\" frequency differences. If this second (lower) frequency enters the mixer stage, it will result in another (difference) signal getting to the IF stages and causing possible interference. This lower frequency is called the \"image\" of the original\n\nfrequency. Again, assuming an IF of 10.7 MHz, a receiver tuned to 200.7 MHz would have its LO at 190.0 MHz. A signal from another transmitter at 179.3 MHz would appear as an image frequency since it is 10.7 MHz below the LO frequency or 21.4 MHz below the operating frequency.\n\nThe image frequency differs from the operating frequency by an amount equal to two times the intermediate frequency (2 x IF). (See Figures 3-9 a & b.) The image frequency will be below the operating frequency for a high-side injection receiver and above the operating frequency for a low-side injection receiver. Thus the image frequency for the typical single conversion receiver is at least 20 MHz away from the operating frequency. Double conversion receivers, which have a relatively high first IF (50 MHz typical), have image frequencies which are even farther (>100 MHz typical) away from the operating frequency. In most cases, the front end of the receiver should be able to reject an image frequency unless it is extremely strong. Nevertheless, it is recommended that operating frequencies be chosen to be at least 250 KHz from any image frequency.\n      The last internal frequency issue concerns the VCO in crystal controlled transmitters. Recall that the actual VCO frequency is a relatively low radio frequency that is multiplied to obtain the final transmitter frequency. A small amount of the original crystal frequency remains after each multiplier stage. Thus the output signal includes not only the final operating frequency but also low-level \"spurs\" or spurious emissions due to the multipliers. These spurs occur above and below the operating frequency at intervals equal to \"harmonics\" (multiples) of the original crystal frequency.\n\nFor example, assuming a 9 x multiplier, a 180 MHz transmitter would have a 20 MHz crystal frequency. This would produce spurs at 160 MHz and 200 MHz, 140 MHz and 220 MHz, etc. Good transmitter design will minimize the amplitude of such crystal harmonics but, again, additional receivers should be chosen to avoid these frequencies by at least 250 KHz. (See Figure 3-10.)\n    Frequency-synthesized transmitters do not produce spurious emissions of this type because they do not employ multipliers. However, both types of transmitters can produce other spurious emissions due to power regulating circuitry, parasitic oscillations, carrier harmonics, etc. These emissions can all be controlled through careful design.\n\nIt can be seen that the calculation of both local oscillator conflicts and image frequencies depends on the intermediate frequency (IF) of the receiver while calculation of crystal harmonics depends on the number of multipliers in the transmitter. If receivers with different IFs or transmitters with different multipliers are being used together (i.e. units from different manufacturers) this must be taken into account in compatibility analysis. Unfortunately, only a few proprietary computer programs for frequency selection have this capability. Input to most of these programs assumes that all units are of the same design. For this reason, accurate prediction of compatibility between systems of different design is not always possible."}, {"question": "We have a wireless Microphone model # SM58.

The form of the decibel relationship for voltage is:\ndB = 20 x log(V1/V2)\nwhere 20 is a constant, V1 is one voltage, V2 is the other voltage, and log is logarithm base 10.\n\nExamples:\n  What is the relationship in decibels between 100 volts and 1 volt?\n\ndB = 20 x log(100/1)\ndB = 20 x log(100)\ndB = 20 x 2 (the log of 100 is 2)\ndB = 40\n\nThat is, 100 volts is 40dB greater than 1 volt.\n\nWhat is the relationship in decibels between 0.001 volt and 1 volt?\n\ndB = 20 x log(0.001/1)\ndB = 20 x log(0.001)\ndB = 20 x (-3) (the log of .001 is -3)\ndB = -6\n\nThat is, 0.001 volt is 60dB less that 1 volt.\nSimilarly:\nif one voltage is equal to the other they are 0dB different\n\nif one voltage is twice the other they are 6dB different\n\nif one voltage is ten times the other they are 20dB different\nWhat is dBV or dBm?\n\nSince the decibel is a ratio of two values, there must be an explicit or implicit reference value for any measurement given in dB. This is usually indicated by a suffix on the decibel value such as: dBV (reference to 1 volt which is 0dBV) or dBm (reference to 0.775 volts). In other words, to calculate dBV, use \"1 volt\" as V2 in the above equations. To calculate dBm, use \"0.774 volts\" as V2 in the above equations. Therefore, dBV and dBm are a little different than just a plain \"dB\" because they have a specific set value for V2. The terms \"dBV\" and \"dBm\" are units of measure, where as the term \"dB\" is not a unit of measure.\n\nWhat is dB SPL\n\nJust like dBV or dBm, dB SPL uses a constant, specific value in the denominator of the equation. dB SPL is referenced to 0.0002 microbar. In other words, 0.0002 microbar is equal to 0 dB SPL. Therefore, if a sound level measures 75 dB SPL, that means the sound is 74 dB greater than 0.0002 microbar. The term \"dB SPL\" is a unit of measure, where as the term \"dB\" is not a unit of measure.\n\nBe very careful about the use of the term \"dB\". The term \"dB\" should only be used when talking about greater than, less than, increased by, or decreased by. At all other times, the terms \"dBV\", \"dBm\", \"dB SPL\", \"dBW\", \"dBs\", etc should be used.\n  Incorrect: \"This microphone has an output level of -54 dB.\"\nCorrect: \"This microphone has an output level of -54 dBV.\"\n\nIncorrect: \"The sound pressure level was 102 dB.\"\nCorrect: \"The sound pressure level was 102 dB SPL.\"\n\nCorrect: \"The first track is 2 dB louder than the second track.\" (This statement is correct because it is specifically stating that the first and second track are being compared. Thus, both values that are being compared are given.)\n\nCorrect: \"John is 1.5 dB taller than Bill.\" (While the decibel is typically used for audio and electrical comparisons, it can be used for other comparisons, such as length, weight, etc.)\nOne reason that the decibel is so useful in certain audio measurements is that this scaling function closely approximates the behavior of human hearing sensitivity. For example, a change of 1dB SPL is about the smallest difference in loudness that can be perceived while a 3dB SPL change is generally noticeable. A 6dB SPL change is quite noticeable and finally, a 10dB SPL change is perceived as \"twice as loud.\""}, {"question": "I have three 588SD microphones which I purchased for use with my sound system that is used for live performances mostly in churches.

How high can I mount it?", "answer": "Answer\nHigher and farther than a single element microphone! However, room acoustics still matter. Noisier and more reverberant environments will impact speech intelligibility at greater distances from the microphone. Because of its three-dimensional steering capability and extremely narrow pick up pattern, the MXA910 can pick up talkers at greater distances than any other microphone.\n\nA useful concept in understanding how far away a microphone may be placed is \"distance factor.\" Distance factor is based on the use of an omnidirectional microphone placed a distance X from a sound source while providing an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio.  Now, at what distance a directional microphone be placed and achieve the same results? For a cardioid microphone, the distance factor is 1.7 times the distance used for the omnidirectional microphone. \n\nThe MXA910 distance factor is an amazing 4.3. In a room where an omnidirectional microphone is used successfully at a distance of 2 feet from the talker, the MXA910 would deliver similar results at a distance of 8.6 feet.  By way of comparison, a highly directional shotgun microphone has a distance factor of only 3. This is what we mean by \"higher and farther than a single element microphone.\"\n\nThe following guidelines must be kept in mind when deciding where to place the MXA910:\nLike all microphones, best practice is to aim lobes towards the front of each talker. Mic lobes aimed at the back of the head lose high frequency response. Carefully consider placement in rooms where talkers may face a screen during a video conference.\nAvoid installing the microphone directly next to unwanted sound sources, such as air vents or noisy projectors.\nConsider installing acoustic treatment to improve speech intelligibility in rooms that are too reverberant."}, {"question": "What microphones did the Beatles use for live performance during the 1960s?", "answer": "Answer\nThe Beatles used a variety of microphones for live PA sound.

It adjusts the gain of a channel based on how loud or soft the input signal is. If the input is loud, the gain is turned down. If the input is soft, the gain is turned up.\n\nThe primary application of the AGC is in spoken word applications. Example: Several different talkers speak into a single microphone on a lectern. Some talkers are soft or talk far away from the microphone, and some talkers are loud or speak close to the microphone. When a soft-spoken person begins to speak, the gain gradually turns up until it is at the pre-set optimal level. The gain stays at this level until another talker addresses the microphone. When a loud talker speaks, the gain gradually gets turned down until it is at the pre-set optimal level.\n\nAnother application is when a lapel microphone is being used. One talker places the lapel microphone close to his mouth and in the center of the chest. Another speaker places her microphone in a less optimal position. The AGC will respond to these situations by turning the gain down or up, respectively.\n\nIf any talker quickly changes her volume by shouting, whispering, or getting very close to the microphone, that 'peak' or 'valley' will pass through the AGC. The AGC will not quickly adjust the gain like a compressor. But if a given talker changes her speech level style for several seconds (based on the attack /decay time), then the AGC will respond with a gain change.\n\nWhat do the AGC attack and decay times mean?\n\nThe attack and decay settings determine how fast the AGC responds to a changing input level. Longer attack / decay times will cause the gain to change more slowly and shorter attack / decay times will result in faster changing gain.\n\nTo determine which to use (attack or decay), the AGC looks at the input level\u2019s direction in relationship to the hinge threshold. The attack time is used when the input level is moving away from the hinge point, and the decay time is used when the input level is moving towards the hinge point.\n\nNote that the AGC is not meant to have a short attack time. A long attack time of 1-2 seconds or more is appropriate. The decay time should also be several seconds. If attack times are too short, the AGC responds too quickly and the benefit of the speech detector is lost.\n\nHow does the Speech Detector work in the AGC? Can the AGC be used with non-speech signals?\n\nThe speech detector in the AGC is more accurately called an \"activity in the speech frequency band\" detector. It detects activity that occurs in the speech range above the level of the ambient room noise. The detector adapts to ambient noise and triggers when it detects some activity above that ambient noise floor.\n\nWhen the speech detector detects the presence of activity in the fundamental speech frequency band, the AGC operates as normal. When the speech detector signals that no activity is detected, the last gain applied is held until the speech detector sees more activity. In this way, the speech detector prevents the \u2018pumping\u2019 of the noise floor while a talker pauses.\n\nThough designed for speech, the AGC with speech detector also works effectively on non-speech signals such as musical instruments or singing. For example, the AGC could turn up a guitar after the player starts finger picking and turn it back down after the player starts strumming.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between the AGC in the DP11EQ (discontinued), P4800 (discontinued), and DFR22?\n\nEach product has a slightly different implementation of the AGC. The original algorithm was developed for the DP11EQ. The implementation in the DFR22 is nearly identical; the only difference is that the DFR22\u2019s AGC has an improved weighting filter in the speech detector. The DP11EQ\u2019s filter causes the speech detector to trigger on the higher portion of the speech band. This band includes mostly fricatives, like \"s\", \"f\", \"sh\", \"k\", etc. The filter in the DFR22 causes the detector to trigger on a slightly lower frequency band that includes the fundamental frequencies of most voiced sounds (vowels). The benefit of the improved weighting filter in the DFR22 is that it will not trigger on incidental mouth noises\n\nThe AGC in the P4800 is different from the AGC in the DFR22 or DP11EQ because it does not include the speech detector. This allows the AGC to be a faster acting processor with shorter attack and decay times, but also makes it susceptible to noise floor pumping. One can approximate the performance of the P4800\u2019s AGC by setting short attack and decay times in the DFR22 of DP11EQ. Short attack and decay times will effectively defeat the speech detector.\n\nHow can the AGC be used for speech leveling?\n\nOften it is desired to get the benefits of the gradual change of AGC yet still have some short term leveling. A good way to accomplish this is to follow the AGC with a compressor. A compressor with a fast attack time will catch and squash peaks that pass through the AGC. If the compressor ratio is set to a moderate level (2:1, 3:1), the talker will still be able to generate a reasonable dynamic range."}, {"question": "Does SLX-D work with Shure Wireless Workbench?", "answer": "Answer\nWireless Workbench v6.14.1 added support for SLX-D.

I have calibrated the cartridge with your protractor and verified that the overhang for my Technics table is at 52mm. Is there something else that I can try?", "answer": "Answer\nFailure of a phono cartridge is rare as there are only a few components inside of the body. There is a coil of wire for the left channel. There is a coil of wire for the right channel. There are two wires from each coil that connect to the output pins at the rear of the cartridge.  And there is a \u201ctunnel\u201d into which the stylus is inserted. Cutaway view of a moving magnet phono cartridge.\n\nWithin the body, the only failure that is common (but not frequent) is when a wire to an output pin becomes disconnected. This cannot be repaired but can be easily tested: Testing a phono cartridge body.\n\nLooking at the stylus, the possible failures are also limited. The stylus shank can be bent or broken. The stylus support bushing can harden or become dislodged. The diamond tip can fall off (rare) or the magnet can fall off (extremely rare.) In each case, replacing the defective stylus with a new one will resolve the issue.\n\nWhen a customer claims that the Shure phono cartridge has failed or does not operate as expected, what is the root cause over 95% of the time?

What is the difference between them?", "answer": "Answer\nThe connector at the end of the cable: QTR = 1/4\" male phone plug; XLR = 3 pin male XLR."}, {"question": "What are some common KSM8 questions and answers?", "answer": "Answer\nThe KSM8 has a wide \"sweet spot.\" What is a\"sweet spot\"?\n\nThe \"sweet spot\" is an audio term that refers to the placement of a microphone, in reference to the vocal artist, for the most natural and balanced sound.  For a vocal microphone, this is critical as the sound quality will vary dependent on how the artist is holding the microphone.  If the artist is holding the mic too close, the audio can sound more muddy or unclear.  Conversely, if the microphone is too far away, the audio can sound thin and distant.  Proper microphone technique is a key element of good sound.  An artist can be inconsistent with microphone placement, and this may mean the sound engineer is required to process the microphone signal for better clarity or fidelity.\n\nThe KSM8 has a wide sweet spot, due to the design of the Dualdyne element and its ability to control proximity effect.  Additionally, the neutral mid/high frequency response of the KSM8 requires little-or-no external signal processing - resulting in consistent, natural-sounding audio, regardless of the artist's mic technique.\n\nHow does the KSM8 compare to the SM58 or Beta 58A?\n\nNo one microphone is the solution to every problem.  Even with the KSM8 introduction, it is important to remember that the SM58 is still consistently chosen for a wide variety of vocal applications, from beginners to touring professionals, as the standard by which other microphones are measured. The Beta 58A, designed for increased gain-before-feedback due to its supercardioid polar pattern, offers a higher output level and hardened grille.  In a sound reinforcement system, the KSM8 addresses proximity effect (the build-up of bass frequencies) in a manner unique for dynamic microphones.\n\nWhat about the KSM8 polar pattern?  \n\nA consistent, uniform polar pattern provides better gain-before-feedback during live stage use.  Shure microphones are the benchmark for accurate polar patterns, resulting in exceptional consistency during performance. The design of the KSM8 Dualdyne cartridge creates a new standard for polar pattern uniformity.  This can be heard when one monitors the off-axis sound (stage-bleed) as picked up by the KSM8 cardioid polar pattern. The off-axis sound is uncolored and natural sounding.\n\nWhy doesn't the KSM8 have switchable polar patterns like the KSM9?  Don't they both use dual diaphragm capsules?  \n\nThe KSM8 is a dynamic microphone; the KSM9 is a condenser microphone. A dynamic microphone process sound waves mechanically whereas a condenser microphone does so electronically.  For a condenser, different polar patterns are achieved by changing the backplate voltage, shifting the capacitance, etc., - these manipulations are essentially electrical in nature.  Currently, there are no such equivalent mechanical processes for a dynamic microphone.\n\nWill there be other dynamic microphones with the Dualdyne cartridge technology?\n\nAt this time, there are no plans for additional Dualdyne models.\n\nIs the KSM8 grill interchangeable with the KSM9 grill?\n\nNo, the two grills have different dimensions and cannot be interchanged."}, {"question": "Can you tell me whether the Shure SM58 or Beta 58 would be better at reducing feedback for live vocals? Some tell me that the Beta would be better because it has a supercardioid pattern; others tell me the normal SM58 is better because it *doesn't* have a supercardioid pattern because the supercardioids apparently have a tail on the back of the pattern which picks up the sound from stage monitors. Also, is there another mic (hopefully in the SM58 or Beta 58 price range) that will do it's best to eliminate feedback? (I understand, of course, that feedback is a function of other speaker placement, EQ, room attributes, etc., but we're considering just the contribution of mics here.) If I must go above $200, what mic is the best for eliminating feedback? ", "answer": "Answer\nIt is impossible to say that the SM58 or Beta 58A is better or worse at feedback rejection. The amount of rejection that each has is completely dependent on the physical relationship of the microphone versus the loudspeakers.\n\nNow, if the microphones are both in an ideal ambient field, the supercardioid would have slightly more rejection, because it is slightly less sensitive to ambient noise coming from all directions. In the ambient field, feedback acts just like any other ambient noise.\n\nThe next part, though, is how the frequency response of the microphone interacts with the frequency response of the room and loudspeakers that are used. Those factors will also have an effect on which microphone will feed back first.\n\nUnfortunately, it is impossible to answer your question. The point of feedback for the SM58 and Beta 58A will be completely dependent on the room, loudspeakers, physical relationship, etc. We could easily get the SM58 to provide more gain before feedback in one situation, and then turn around and get the Beta 58A to provide more gain before feedback in a second situation. You cannot just consider the contribution of microphones when talking about feedback. Feedback only occurs when you have a complete sound system with all components interacting with each other. How these components interact will decide when feedback occurs.\n\nAs an analogy, consider two cars. The first car has a 4 cylinder engine that produces 190 horsepower. The second car has a V8 that produces 300 horsepower. Now, which car goes faster? Well, if the first car only weighs 1500 pounds (typical for a race car) and the second car weighs 3000 pounds (typical for a street car), the smaller, less powerful car will actually win. So, it's not just how much power the engine has, but how the engine, car, transmission, et al, interact together.\n\nMore information: How do I fix my feedback problem?"}, {"question": "I have two Shure microphines ( SM57 and SM58 ).

Every digital audio device contains a clock, which is used to accurately time out the capture and playback of digital audio samples, much like a metronome helps a musician keep time. When multiple digital audio devices are connected together, they all need to share a common reference to make sure that audio is captured and played back in sync. Dante achieves this using the Precision Time Protocol, which is also known as PTPv1 or IEEE1588-2002.\n\nIn a Dante network, one device is assigned the role of Primary Leader Clock, and the rest of the devices will synchronize their internal clock to the Primary Leader Clock. This device can either be elected automatically by way of the PTP protocol, or it can be manually selected by a user in Dante Controller.\n\nUnless a network has hundreds of devices, any Dante device can serve as the Primary Leader Clock without any performance penalty. It's best to select a stable device which is unlikely to be rebooted or turned off as the Primary Leader Clock to avoid audio glitches on the network if the Primary Leader Clock role is transferred to a new device.\n\nThe Primary Leader Clock does not need to be synchronized to any particular real-world time source, such as GPS. All that matters is that the device can maintain precise time over long periods, like a good wristwatch does. This ensures that audio is always captured and played back accurately. All Dante devices have dedicated chips on board to handle this task.\n\nHow do I set up Dante clocking?\n\nAs previously mentioned, in a normal Dante network one device will automatically be selected as the Primary Leader Clock. If you have a preference for which device or devices should be the preferred clock, then select those in Dante Controller on the Clock tab. Ensure that one and only one device is listed as the Primary Leader Clock, at the top of the Dante Controller screen.\n\nTroubleshooting Clock Issues\n\nThe PTP clock protocol relies on Multicast IP traffic to communicate among devices on a Dante network. It also assumes that Ethernet switches will consistently pass the clock packets to their destination immediately upon receiving one. While most unmanaged Ethernet switches handle this task well, some do not. The two most common causes are Energy Efficient Ethernet (IEEE 802.3az, or Green Ethernet), and incorrectly configured Multicast settings.\n\nBe sure that the network switch you purchase for Dante networks is not on our disqualified list. In addition, check the product documentation to ensure that the switch does not have Energy Efficient Ethernet, Green Ethernet, or 802.3az--or that it can be disabled if it does.\n\nIf the switch supports configuration, you may need to disable all Multicast Filtering for smaller networks of Dante-only devices. For larger networks or networks with AES67, see Dante Networks and IGMP Snooping, and our Enterprise Network Troubleshooting Checklist.\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to isolate Dante Clock traffic to a small network.\n\nFor the curious, we have a more detailed FAQ on clocking: Dante and AES Clocking In Depth."}, {"question": "What does in mean (for instance on a digital video camera) there is a choice of \"microphone\" and \"microphone att?\" Does it mean \"attenuated?\" In any case, what would be the difference in plugging a mike into either one of these inputs?", "answer": "Answer\nAtt is an abbreviation for Attenuated.

However, the cures are simple and will eliminate hum in many cases when the outline below is followed:\nTurn down volume control. If hum persists, it is originating in the power amplifier or interconnections.  Service may be required.   If  hum decreases as volume is turned down, proceed to next step.\nThere must be a connection from the metal parts of the turntable to the chassis of the preamp/amplifier; from there to ground on a water pipe, a grounded electric outlet box, or a radiator. Also, try reversing the AC plugs on the amplifier, the turntable, and the preamp. If hum persists, proceed to next step.\nDisconnect the phonograph plugs from the preamp or amplifier. If the hum persists, or is present when a tuner or tape recorder is played through the system, the problem is localized in the preamp or amplifier.  Service may be required. If  hum disappears, reinsert the plugs, proceed to next step.\nCheck to see that the turntable is not located next to, on top of, or underneath a power amplifier, tuner, tape recorder, or any item using a transformer or motor. A transformer or motor can create a localized hum field.  If hum persists with the turntable isolated, proceed to next step.\nTurn the turntable motor On and Off. If hum disappears when motor is Off, the motor has an excessive hum field. This situation is rare, except when a magnetic pickup has been installed in a vintage turntable designed for ceramic pickups. If hum is present when motor is Off, proceed to next step.\nIf hum increases when a human hand is brought near the phono cartridge headshell, it is likely that the metal shield in the cartridge is not being grounded by the connections.  If a plastic headshell is used, the metal grounding clip on the cartridge terminal marked \"RG\" should be in place. If a metal shell is used, and the hum is steady, removing the grounding clip may help. If the hum persists, replace the clip and proceed to next step.\nCheck the cable connections on the underside of the phonograph base. There should be no connection from the shield of the cables to the metal turntable parts, If there is, remove it and install a separate ground wire, as in Step 2.\nIf the tonearm wiring has only three wires, or two shielded wires with the shields connected, then a special three-wire cable should be used between phonograph and amplifier. Alternately, two single conductor shielded wires may be used if the shield of one is left \"floating\" at the phonograph.\n  If these steps do not cure the trouble, try a different cartridge. Though unlikely, there could be an internal grounding problem within the phono cartridge body."}, {"question": "What is the WA653 accessory?", "answer": "Answer\nWA653 Mic Flag Extender Kit\n\nIntroduced in January 2017, the WA653 Microphone Flag Kit extends a Shure wireless transmitter handle to accommodate the length of a microphone station ID flag.

What are the model differences?", "answer": "Answer\nA brief history of the V15:\nV15 1964-1966\nV15 Type II 1966-1970\nV15 Type II Improved 1970-1973\nV15 Type III 1973-1978\nV15 Type IV 1978-1982\nV15 Type V 1982-1983\nV15 Type V-MR 1983-1993\nV15 Type VxMR 1996-2005\nOne distinctive difference between each generation of the V15 is the shape and dimensions of the Pole Pieces and Stylus Brass Housing. This means that the styli are not interchangeable from one generation to the next. They do not provide a proper fit, or alignment, between the Magnet and Pole Pieces.\n\nIn 1983, Shure introduced the Micro-Ridge (MR) diamond for the V15 Type V. Shure also offered the Micro-Ridge diamond on replacement styli for V15 Type III and Type IV. Again, long term quantities were estimated and produced. Circumstantially, the tooling for the V15 Type V allowed for additional production of Type III replacement styli. This accounts for the larger availability of Type III and Type V replacement styli.\n\nShure experienced dramatic shifts in demand for phono cartridges when the CD Player was introduced in the late 1980\u2019s. In the early 1990\u2019s cartridge sales plummeted, OEM business ceased, and Shure gave serious consideration to ending all phono production.\n\nIn 1995, under new phono management, Shure re-engineered our phono products and manufacturing process to allow us to produce significantly lower quantities, maintain our quality standards, locate reliable suppliers, and maintain a fair market price. The action allowed Shure to remain in the phono cartridge business, but unfortunately, required that we cease to support pre-1995 products beyond the final inventory build-ups.\n\nFor V15 products, a replacement stylus was typically available for years after the cartridge was officially discontinued. Some inventory usually remained in the retail channel for 2-3 years.\n\nShure\u2019s inventory of VN45E, VN45HE, and VN45MR styli completely expired in the late 1990\u2019s. We are unable to re-produce this part due to scarcity of tooling and raw materials.\n\nThe V15VxMR, was discontinued in 2005.

In one small area of my studio (near my mains circuit breaker/electrical panel) I have some type of electrical interference and all my microphones except the Neumann mics have hum when turned in a certain direction. If I turn the mics 90 degrees, the hum disappears. The Neumann mics (U87s and U64s) have no hum in any direction and work fine. The SM57 and EV 635 that I have has this hum in this same placement. Do you think the hum comes from mic transformers that are not shielded or not shielded enough?", "answer": "Answer\nThe likely source of the problem is a hum field in your studio caused by the AC power lines.\n\nAny type of dynamic mic, like the Shure SM57 or EV 635, contains a voice coil that is very susceptible to picking up the hum field. Nothing can be added to these mics to control this.\n\nSome dynamic mics contain an internal hum bucking coil, like the Shure SM7B, that reduces hum pick-up....reduces, not eliminates. Some dynamic mics, like the Shure Beta 58, have more effective shielding around the voice coil; that also reduces hum.\n\nBut ALL dynamic mics will pick up this hum field to some extent.\n\nCondenser mics, like the Neumann's or the Shure KSM mics, do not have voice coils. These mics will perform much better in a hum field. But many of these mics have output transformers that, like a voice coil, will also pick up the hum.\n\nIf the hum field cannot be eliminated, stick with high quality condenser mics with transformerless outputs.

Are there guidelines on the acoustic qualities of the room that we should be taken into account?", "answer": "Answer\nTo maximize the success of any conferencing facility, a number of factors must be considered during planning and implementation. The list includes:\nAcoustic qualities - room noise floor, external noise sources, technical noise (projectors, fans), building noise (e.g. HVAC), and reverberation qualities\nLighting - configurations for different types of meeting scenarios including video projection or video conferencing\nComfort Level - space per occupant (square feet), furniture, HVAC\nVisual - Projection systems and video conferencing monitor sight lines, general aesthetics\nFollowing is a brief discussion of the acoustic qualities issue:\n\nSignal to noise is a metric that takes into account the ambient noise of a room, which includes any undesired sounds that can be heard or measured. This includes noise from heating/ventilating/air conditioning, building mechanical systems (e.g. elevators), technical (e.g. projectors, lighting control systems, etc.), and sounds from outside the room (such as airplanes, cars/trucks, weather, adjacent noisy spaces, e.g. cafeterias and mechanical rooms). The general industry guideline for the absolute minimum signal to noise metric in a conference room is 20 dB. For best results, the conference room facility should be designed for a signal to noise metric of at least 25 dB. More is definitely better!\n\nExample 1 - the noise floor in a room measures 55 dB SPL A weighted (slow). If normal speech is assumed to be 70 dB SPL A weighted (slow), then the signal to noise metric of the room is 70-55 or 15 dB. This room will be challenging for conference use.\n\nExample 2 - the noise floor in a room measures 42 dB SPL A weighted (slow). If normal speech is assumed to be 70 dB SPL A weighted (slow), then the signal to noise metric of the room is 70-42 or 28 dB. This room is an excellent candidate for conferencing.\n\nTechnical noise in a conference room is often overlooked. Technical noise can come from video projectors, computers, and other audio/video support equipment. Often times, the offending noise is from cooling fans in the A/V equipment. Fans generally produce a broad-spectrum noise that is similar to the sound produced by sound masking systems. Fan noise can be very annoying as well as detrimental to intelligibility and clarity in hearing. Every effort should be made to silence technical equipment or to specify/install quiet equipment in the conference room.\n\nSimilarly, HVAC systems can produce high levels of broad-spectrum noise. Air movement systems should be carefully engineered to minimize air velocity in ducts and through diffusers. Isolating mechanical noise from air handlers is also important - this type of noise can come through the ductwork as well as mechanically through the building structure.\n\nSome building materials and room shapes that will often cause acoustical problems include:\nLarge glass surfaces - walls or windows\nLarge drywall surfaces\nLarge marker board surfaces\nNon-sound-absorptive ceiling material\nConcave wall or ceiling shapes\nThe reverberation characteristics of a conference room are very important. These construction materials and characteristics can contribute to excessive sound reflections that will detract from a quality meeting experience. Proper design will yield a room that minimizes reverberation, but is also not too \"dead-sounding.\"\n\nUtilizing an acoustical consultant to work with the architect in specifying the room design will be money well spent.\n\nFor additional information on Conference and Meeting Rooms, refer to Shure's Educational Brochure \"Audio Systems Guide for Meeting Facilities.\""}, {"question": "What is the procedure to calibrate the VU meter on a Shure mixer?", "answer": "Answer\nHow to Calibrate the VU Meter on a Shure Mixer\n\nWhy does a VU meter require calibration?\n\nA VU meter indicates the signal level being sent from the mixer to the next device. A VU meter can be calibrated to any reference level desired. In the United States, the most common reference level is 0VU = +4dBm. That is, when the VU meter needle is lined up with 0 reading on the meter face, the audio signal at the output of the mixer has a level of +4dBm. Please note that the 0 indication on any VU meter has no pre-determined value. 0 VU is simply a point of reference.\n\nWhat does +4dBm equal in volts?\n\n+4dBm equals a signal voltage of 1.23 volts measured across a 600 ohm load.\n\nWhat is required to calibrate a VU meter for a reference level of 0VU = +4dBm?\n\nIn addition to basic soldering skills, a soldering iron, and solder, you will require:\nA multimeter that can accurately measure audio signal levels at 1,000 Hz.

Please ease my anxious mind!", "answer": "Answer\nThe SM57 and SM58 microphones are based on the same cartridge design. The main difference is in the grille design. The SM58 was designed for vocal application and it uses a ball grille that acts as an effective pop filter. The SM57 was designed as an instrument microphone where a smaller grille size is preferred. In this application, pop and wind are not usually a concern.\n\nThe SM57 uses an integral resonator/grille assembly, where grille is actually a part of the cartridge. These two grille designs place the diaphragm of each microphone in a different acoustical environment. The distance from the top of the grille to the diaphragm is shorter on the SM57 compared to that of the SM58. This allows for a closer miking position with a more pronounced proximity effect. The different resonator/grille assembly design of the SM57 is also responsible for its slightly higher output above 5 kHz."}, {"question": "I just purchased Shure earphones. What is the procedure to remove the flexible sleeves?", "answer": "Answer\nShure earphones are packaged with sleeves on the stems. During periods of storage and shipping, the sleeves can adhere to the stems. Given the choice between a sleeve that is difficult to remove and a sleeve that easily comes off, the difficult-to-remove sleeve is preferred so that it does not accidentally detach and remain in the ear canal.\n\nPlease try the methods below and in this order:\n\nMethod 1: Most of the time, it will work best to get a finger nail behind the sleeve and pull the sleeve off the stem. \"Walk\" the sleeve off the stem by moving the fingernail from one side of the stem to the other. While pulling upward with the fingernails, rotate the earphone with the other hand.\n\nMethod 2: Use a shirt, a towel, or paper towel to securely grasp the sleeve. Twist and pull the sleeve away from the nozzle while gently rocking the sleeve from left to right.\n\nMethod 3: Place the earphones in the freezer overnight. The plastic will shrink slightly and break the adhesion between the sleeve and the nozzle. The cold temperature will not damage the earphones. Be careful: Do not break off the earphone nozzle.\n\nMethod 4: This method will ruin the flexible sleeve.  Use a staple remover.  Clamp it around the flexible sleeve and gently pull upward. The earphone stem is small enough to fit the gap in the middle of the staple remover jaws.\n\nTry method 1 first. Method 2 and Method 3 have a risk of breaking the earphone nozzle.

However, before installing or commissioning an MXA910, we recommend completing the MXA910/MXA310 Training and Certification. This free course through the Shure Audio Institute explains how the MXA910 works and walks you through the setup process. It also answers any common questions you may have.\n\nShure recommends using Shure Designer to configure all MXA910 microphones, even those already deployed in the field. Designer allows you to import a floor plan, set it to scale, and then place your MXA910 microphones where they actually are in the room\u2014making it easy to visualize lobe placement and audio coverage. Designer also works with the IntelliMix P300 and IntelliMix Room processors to optimize the audio flow and settings, all from one tool. The MXA910 User\u2019s Guide has detailed setup instructions using Designer in the Getting Started section. We recommend starting with this before making major changes to the MXA910 configuration.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve gone through the basic configuration using Shure Designer, evaluate the sound of the microphone and determine if it\u2019s acceptable. While you can do this via a test call through the room's conferencing system, be aware that the audio codec\u2019s compression artifacts may color the sound making it hard to judge just the mic. The same goes for using a third-party DSP if that DSP isn't configured properly. Instead, we recommend listening to the mic in the room with a good pair of headphones.

So if you have not used your wireless microphone system for a while or it is a new setup, test the whole audio system before your event.\n\nSetting up:\n\nCheck your equipment\nMake sure there are not broken or missing pieces\nMake sure all cables and connectors are in good condition, no nicks or cuts on the insulation.\nMake sure you have new batteries.\n\nUse the proper cables and connectors to attach the output of the receiver to the input of the mixer or amplifier.\nCables with 1/4\" phone plugs or RCA plugs on the ends should be kept under 10 feet in length.\nCables with 3 pin \"XLR\" connectors on the ends can be several hundred feet in length.\n\nMake sure the output of the receiver is connected to the proper input of the mixer or amplifier.\nFollow the directions in your wireless systems User's Guide.\nMicrophone level outputs must go into microphone level inputs\nAux/Line level outputs must go into aux or line level inputs.\n\nLocate receiver and its antennas away from any potential sources of interference, such as:\nDigital equipment: CD players, MP3 players, digital signal processors, computers, digital electronic musical instruments and computer driven equipment.\nAC power equipment: Lighting dimmers and some neon or fluorescent light ballast.\n\nMaintain line-of-sight between microphone/transmitter and receiver.\nThe microphone user should be able to see the antennas.\nAvoid metal objects, walls, and large numbers of people between the microphone/transmitter and receiver. Ideally, the receiving antennas should be in the same room as the transmitters and elevated above the audience or other obstructions.\nKeep antennas from different receivers at least 3 feet apart.\nIf the receiver antenna is positioned vertically, make sure the antenna on the microphone/transmitter antenna is positioned vertically.\nThe body pack antenna should be vertical.\nThe handheld microphones' position is going to be variable, so the receiver antennas may be angled up to 45 degrees from vertical.\n\nKeep the distance between microphone/transmitter and receiver as short as practical.\nMinimum distance between microphone/transmitter and receiver distance is 10 feet.\nMaximum distance between microphone/transmitter and receiver distance depends on the environment in which the system is used. Outdoors, the system may work up to 1,000 feet while indoors, it may be only 50 feet.\n\nSystem Checkout and Operation:\n\nUse Only Fresh Batteries\n\nTurn on the wireless receiver. Turn on the microphone/transmitter. Turn on the amplifier last.\n\nStand in one place, talk into the microphone, and listen to see if the audio level is adequate.\n\nDo a \"walk-around\" test to verify no drop outs or interference.\n\n\nTear down:\n\nPower down all your equipment. Turn the amplifier off first. Then turn off the rest of the equipment.\n\nDisconnect the cables. Coil them up and tie them off with a twist tie to keep them from tangling. This prolongs the life of the cables.\n\nIf you have used the body pack and headset microphone for an aerobics application, dry it off with a towel. Unplug the microphone cable and dry off the connector.\nKeeping the cable connections clean and dry will prevent corrosion.\n\n  Don't crumple up the body pack antenna in your pocket or aerobics pack. Extend the antenna all the way. If necessary, hide it under clothing. If the antenna is crumpled up, you will get intermittent sound at best, no sound at worst.\nThe receiver antennas must remain attached to the receiver when it is in use.\nHave extra cables, and microphones, and body packs available in case of loss or damage, especially if used for aerobics. Professional sound engineers realize that cables and microphones do go bad. They always carry extras so that the show can go on.\n\nProperly maintaining your audio system, cables, and microphones extends the life of the equipment. Taking a few moments to clean and pack up your equipment correctly can save you from nasty surprises later on."}, {"question": "Can Designer be installed on the same PC as IntelliMix Room?", "answer": "Answer\nShure does not support installing IMXR and Designer onto the same computer"}, {"question": "Is it possible to password protect the IntelliMix Room Windows Tray App?", "answer": "Answer\nAs of 3.0.4 and later, the tray app can be password protected by setting a device password using Shure Designer."}, {"question": "Can the NIC associated with the Intellimix Room License be changed after installation?", "answer": "Answer\nThis cannot be easily changed after installation.

That is, I want the receiver and transmitter to both be rack mounted and AC powered. What can I use?", "answer": "Answer\nWIRELESS POINT-TO-POINT AUDIO USING AN SLX4 RECEIVER (Discontinued)\n\nCertain sound system applications require sending audio from a central location to one or more remote locations without using cable. Various combinations of wireless microphone and personal monitor systems can be configured to send audio via a radio link to meet this need. This FAQ discusses implementation of a wireless audio link using the Shure P9T transmitter and an SLX4 receiver (Discontinued).\n\nBoth the P9T transmitter and SLX4 receiver products can be rack mounted, and they both can be AC powered. This is especially useful for permanent or semi-permanent installations, where AC power is available. It also eliminates the need to replace batteries. The P9T and SLX4 are both tunable in 25 kHz steps throughout their operating frequency ranges, providing excellent flexibility in frequency selection.\n\nHere are the implementation steps:\n\nStep 1 - Frequency Selection\n\nIdentify available frequency spectrum in the area where the system will be used. The P9T and SLX4 can operate in the following UHF TV Broadcast frequency ranges:\n470 - 542 MHz, TV channels 14 - 25\nProcedure:\nUsing various resources, such as the FCC TV broadcast database, RF spectrum scanning equipment (if available), and the Shure online Frequency Finder tool, identify vacant TV channels in the above listed ranges. Be sure to identify any nearby low-power TV stations and any proposed new TV stations which may cause interference both now and later.\nIdentify any TV channels that are reserved for Public Safety communications in the area of operation. Wireless audio operation is prohibited in these reserved channels. When using frequencies in the G4, G5, G6 and G7 bands, it is imperative to avoid local public safety frequencies. See Public Safety FAQ.\nOnce vacant TV channels are identified, select a candidate equipment and frequency band combination:\nTV Channels\nFrequency Range (MHz)\nTransmitter Band\nReceiver Band\n14 - 17\n470 - 494\nP9T-G6\nSLX4-G4\n18 - 19\n494 - 506\nP9T-G6\nSLX4-G5\n20 - 21\n506 - 518\nP9T-G7\nSLX4-G5\n22 - 25\n518 - 542\nP9T-G7\nSLX4-H5\n  The best combinations will include more vacant TV channels. In some areas, more than one equipment and frequency combination may be equally desirable.\n\nIf no other UHF wireless audio equipment is to be used at the location, use the SLX system frequency table in the product User Guide to select a frequency in a vacant TV channel. Make a note of the selected frequency band (G4, G5, or H5), the group/channel number, and the numerical frequency in MHz - this information will be used to program the equipment in a later step.\n\nIf other wireless microphones, personal monitors, and intercom equipment will be used at the same venue, an inventory of all equipment and frequencies of the wireless equipment is required. It will be necessary to use a software program, such as the Shure Wireless Workbench, to synthesize and coordinate a set of compatible operating frequencies.\n\nStep 2 - Modify the SLX4 Receiver to Defeat the Tone Key Squelch Circuit.\n\nThe tone key squelch function of the P9T transmitters and SLX4 receivers are different.

A device's clock is the part that ensures that audio plays back in time and at the correct speed. Think of it as a metronome for the audio samples. When multiple digital audio devices are connected together, they all need to share a common reference to make sure that audio is captured and played back in sync. Dante achieves this using the Precision Time Protocol, which is also known as PTPv1 or IEEE1588-2002.\n\nHow does clocking work in a Dante network?\n\nIn a Dante network, one device is assigned the role of Primary Leader Clock, and the rest of the devices will synchronize their internal clock to the Primary Leader Clock. This device can either be elected automatically by way of the PTP protocol, or it can be manually selected by a user in Dante Controller.\n\nUnless a network has hundreds of devices, any Dante device can serve as the Primary Leader Clock without any performance penalty. It's best to select a stable device which is unlikely to be rebooted or turned off as the Primary Leader Clock to avoid audio glitches on the network if the Primary Leader Clock role is transferred to a new device.\n\nThe Primary Leader Clock does not need to be synchronized to any particular real-world time source, such as GPS. All that matters is that the device can maintain precise time over long periods, like a good wristwatch does. This ensures that audio is always captured and played back accurately. All Dante devices have dedicated chips on board to handle this task.\n\nEach Unicast Dante Flow, or audio stream, consists of four channels of audio. Each UDP packet contains 32 samples of audio for each of the four channels (when there are fewer than four channels, the rest are sent as silence). Each Dante Transmitter embeds the \"current\" time (per the Primary Leader Clock) into each packet of audio it generates. This is the time that the particular packet of audio was captured. Each receiver guarantees a specific amount of latency (usually 1 millisecond), and so with an accurate clock and a packet timestamp, the receiver can play back audio from multiple sources exactly in sync. This buffer can be adjusted in Dante Controller for some devices.\n\nHow does clocking work when using AES67 Flows?\n\nAES67 uses PTPv2 (IEEE1588-2008) as its clocking standard. PTPv2 can coexist on the same network with PTPv1. If you are using AES67 on your Shure devices, the device selected as the Dante Primary Leader Clock will try to become the AES67 (PVPv2, or v2) Primary Leader Clock as well. The only time this may not be the case is when a high-precision clock source is in use. In this case, the Dante Primary Leader Clock will synchronize to the high-precision clock. See the Advanced Clocking section below for more information on these cases.\n\nDante Multicast Flows and AES67 Flows are assembled in the same way as Dante unicast flows, although the number of samples and channels per packet can vary.\n\nClocking Problems and Remedies\n\nThe PTP clock protocol relies on Multicast IP traffic to communicate among devices on a Dante network. It also assumes that Ethernet switches will consistently pass the clock packets to their destination immediately upon receiving one. If clocking is not functioning correctly, Dante Controller may report that multiple devices are all attempting to act as the Primary Leader Clock or that the Primary Leader Clock is unknown, or devices may randomly mute and unmute. The most common cause of these issues is that devices can't see all of the traffic in the PTP multicast group (224.0.1.129). If you are experiencing any of these issues, first verify that the switches at your site are not on our list of disqualified network switches, and replace them if they are disqualified.\n\nSome common network types and clock problem remedies are listed below.\n\nSingle Unmanaged Network Switch\nEnsure the switch does not feature Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE, IEEE 802.3az, or Green Ethernet).\nPower cycle the switch.\nUpdate the firmware on all Shure equipment to the latest version.\nTry replacing the switch with a known good network switch.\nSingle Managed Network Switch\nPower cycle the switch.\nVerify that the switch settings are configured correctly (see Dante Networks and IGMP Snooping). In particular, ensure IGMP Snooping is enabled and the querier is running. If video is present, verify QOS settings.\nUpdate the firmware on all Shure equipment to the latest version.\nTry replacing the switch with a known good network switch.\nMultiple Managed Network Switches, Connected Together\nVerify that the switch settings are configured correctly (see Dante Networks and IGMP Snooping).\nEnsure that only one switch is running the IGMP querier.\nVerify that the non-querier switches recognize the port connected to the querier switch as a multicast router port.\nBreak the network apart, and verify that each switch's mini-network behaves properly on its own.\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to isolate Dante Clock traffic to a small network. This addresses how to do this: How do I isolate Dante traffic?\n\nAdvanced Clocking Information\n\nPTP In Depth\n\nPTP is a network protocol developed by the IEEE which allows devices on an IP network to synchronize to a single Leader clock. On a well-behaved network, PTP allows for sub-millisecond time agreement between devices. There are two versions of PTP commonly in use: PTPv1 (IEEE1588-2002) and PTPv2 (IEEE1588-2008). Both PTPv1 and PTPv2 coexist on the same network. In most cases, one device will act as a Boundary clock, and keep both protocols in lock-step.\n\nThe AES67 network audio standard specifies PTPv2 (also known as IEEE1588-2008) as its clocking and synchronization protocol, while the Dante standard specifies PTPv1 as its clocking and synchronization protocol. Dante-based audio devices will use PTPv1 to synchronize with a Leader clock, even when operating in AES67 mode. If there is a higher prevision PTPv2 clock on a network, then one Dante device will synchronize to the higher-precision PTPv2 clock and act as a Boundary clock for PTPv1 devices.  Shure recommends allowing a single Shure device to act as the Leader clock for both PTPv1 and PTPv2 clients (if an MXWAPT is on the network, it must be the Primary Leader Clock).\n\nPTP uses Multicast network traffic to communicate on a network. UDP messages are sent to multicast group 224.0.1.129, which all devices on a network join in order to synchronize. The PTPv2 Primary Leader Clock sends out multiple Announce messages to let devices on the network know that the Primary Leader Clock is the clock to synchronize to. The PTPv1 Primary Leader Clock includes the Announce information in its regular Sync messages.\n\nIn both PTPv1 and PTPv2, the Primary Leader Clock (or a Boundary clock, when multiple clocking domains are joined) sends out multiple Sync and Follow_Up messages per second, which propagate to all devices on the network segment. These messages are used to determine the time it takes for packets to make it from the clock to the device. Devices also periodically send Delay_Request messages, to the Primary Leader Clock, with replies with Delay_Response messages. These messages are used to determine the time it takes for packets to make it from the device back to the clock. Devices take the average of these, and use it to bring their own internal clock into alignment with the time sent by the Primary Leader Clock.\n\nTiming accuracy with PTP is directly related to the accuracy and stability of the Leader Clock. The Leader Clock is a device on a network which has been elected to this role through an election process defined in the PTP standard. The algorithm takes into account the device's reported stability and accuracy, and breaks ties based on the MAC address of the devices tied for eligibility. In some networks, such as in television facilities or cellular networks, a Leader Clock with GPS-synchronized time is necessary for equipment to function correctly. This is generally not required for Dante or AES67 networks in most situations. Devices which are not GPS-disciplined are generally referred to as Arbitrary Clocks, and all that is required is that the device can generate time that meet the specifications set forth in AES11.\n\nClock Election\nThis flowchart explains how the Leader Clock is elected on a Dante network:"}, {"question": "How can I connect my MV7 to a DSLR or mirrorless digital camera?", "answer": "Answer\nThere are two ways to connect an MV7 to a digital camera with a 3.5mm stereo mic input. Both methods have slightly different drawbacks.\n\nXLR to 3.5mm via Shure A96F Cable\nWe recommend using the Shure A96F cable, which is designed to adapt balanced XLR microphones for use with cameras with external stereo microphone inputs. With the A96F, you can directly connect the XLR output of the MV7 to the camera without powering the MV7. However, the mic controls will not be active and no adjustments are possible. The signal is taken before it goes through the internal mic processor, so significant gain may be required to attain usable levels.\n\n3.5mm \"Aux\" Cable\nThe 3.5mm headphone output on the MV7 can be used to send audio to the camera, as long as the MV7 is powered by a phone, tablet, or computer. An external USB battery will not work, unfortunately. The headphone output is a stereo output, and with a 3.5mm to 3.5mm TRS cable you should be able to get good levels. We recommend setting the camera's gain fairly low, and the headphone output fairly high, to reduce the amount of noise picked up by the unbalanced 3.5mm aux cable. The advantage to this technique is that you can take advantage of the onboard mic processing on the MV7. Note: we recommend disabling the bias voltage supplied by the camera (usually in the range of 2-5 Vdc) to avoid undesired noise in the recording.

Each room will need an MXWAPT with enough channels to support the total number of microphones you wish to use at once, as well as a charger with enough slots. When moving the microphones from room to room, you will need to dock the mics and press the link button until the charger indicates the mics have been relinked. Mics do not roam between MXWAPT units on their own.\n\nExample Configuration\nA convention center has three breakout rooms, each with two permanently assigned lapel microphones (MXW1), and six shared handheld microphones (MXW2/SM58) which are intended to be used in any room. Each of the three rooms is equipped with an MXWAPT8 and an MXWNCS8. The MXWNCS is on the same network as the MXWAPT. The handheld microphones may be distributed in any combination among the three rooms, and prior to the meeting, the technician places the mics into the MXWNCS8 and holds down the link button for six seconds. The Link LED shows solid green, and the handheld mics are now ready to use in this room.\n\nWe highly recommended labeling each microphone to indicate which slot it should be linked to, which prevents another microphone from being unlinked. However, simply placing a microphone into the charger will not re-link it\u2014the link button must be depressed for six seconds until you receive a green light.\n\nPlease note that this procedure does not allow for \"roaming\", where the mic can be taken from room to room without relinking. The mic is tied to the access point to which it was last linked and cannot hand-off its signal to another MXWAPT.\n\nBe sure all equipment is running the latest firmware. Components on different firmware versions will not communicate.\n\nFor more information on combine/divide rooms, please check out MXW and a room combining system."}, {"question": "What are the differences between the SB900A and SB900B batteries?", "answer": "Answer\nIn July of 2021, Shure replaced the SB900A with the SB900B.

Why is it doing that and how do I stop it?", "answer": "Answer\nShure network audio devices send audio data over the network to other devices which wish to receive the audio traffic. There are three different types of network traffic that the products can transmit: Dante Unicast, Dante Multicast, and AES67. All of these modes produce sustained traffic as long as the device is powered up--traffic levels do not vary based on the audio level or whether a conference room is on a call.\n\nDante Unicast traffic is sent in flows containing four channels of audio--even when only one channel is present. At 48 kHz / 24 bit, each Unicast flow will be approximately 4.6 Mbps of sustained traffic. This traffic will not flood a network, as it is unicast UDP traffic.\n\nDante Multicast traffic is sent in flows containing one or more channels of audio. Each channel of audio adds approximately 1.15 Mbps of traffic to the flow. For example, if you had a Dante Multicast flow containing eight channels of audio, the flow would have a sustained bit rate of approximately 9.2 Mbps. Note that in some situations, this traffic may flood a network. This can happen when no devices are listening to this device (that is, no devices have subscribed to this Multicast group) or if IGMP Snooping is disabled or configured incorrectly.\n\nAES67 traffic is sent in flows containing one to eight channels of audio. Each channel of audio adds approximately 1.15 Mbps of traffic to the flow. For example, if you had an AES67 flow containing eight channels of audio, the flow would have a sustained bit rate of approximately 9.2 Mbps. Note that in some situations, this traffic may flood a network. This can happen when no devices are listening to this device (that is, no devices have subscribed to this Multicast group) or if IGMP Snooping is disabled or configured incorrectly.\n\nIf traffic is flooding your network, we recommend enabling IGMP Snooping and subscribing at least one device to the sender's audio stream. See Configuring a Network Switch for Shure Devices and Dante/AES67 for details on switch configuration. Note: if you do not have more than one receiver for a device, and all of your equipment is Dante-enabled, then Dante Multicast or AES67 streams are not required. Use Dante Controller to delete the Multicast streams for your device."}, {"question": "I have a P300 or ANIUSB-MATRIX set up for Mute Sync with Microsoft Teams or Zoom and would like my Crestron or AMX touch panel to reflect the mute state.

See the MXC User's Guide for further information, as it uses a different protocol.\n\nHelpful Tips and Hints\nMake certain you are using the correct IP address and TCP port. Your control system should initiate a TCP connection on port 2202 to the Shure Control IP address of the device you want to control. Make certain the device and the controller are in the same network subnet, or that a gateway is specified and routing exists between subnets (see IP Addresses and Subnet Masks for more details).\n\nShure devices don't support sending command strings to an arbitrary destination--a control system must connect to the Shure device over TCP.\n\nShure control strings are always on and can not be turned off or defeated on the Shure product.\n\nEnsure you have included the angle brackets at the beginning and end of the command. For example:\n< GET MODEL >\nShure commands do not use line endings, such as CR or LF.\n\nYou cannot customize the command strings the Shure products use. Each product has a fixed set of commands and responses, which can be found on our Documentation Finder. Your control system will need to generate and parse these commands.\n\nShure devices will send certain REP commands to your control system automatically. For example, some products with mute capability will alert you when a user presses the mute button. You don't generally need to poll for these, and you should be prepared to parse strings which arrive without an initial query.\n\nDo not close and reopen the socket repeatedly. Simply open the socket and leave it open.\n\nTesting the Connection\nTo test the Shure product, you can use PuTTY or PacketSender to initiate a connection and manually send commands and observe the response. Make certain your computer and the Shure device are on the same network subnet, or that you can ping the Shure device from your computer. Also ensure your device is running the latest firmware.\n\nHere is an example. In PuTTY, enter the IP address of the Shure Product. Change the connection type to \"Raw\", and enter the correct Port number.\n\n\n\nClick OPEN.\n\n\n\nFor example, with an SCM820, if you mute a channel in the GUI or on the front panel, the SCM820 will send REP command strings.\n\n\n\nYou can also directly type commands, such as getting the channel name. It may be helpful to write the command in Notepad and paste it in.\n\n\n\nThe SCM820 will respond with the channel name.\n\n "}, {"question": "Why did Shure make DY, CA, CB, CM, CR, CX, and GR models of standard Shure microphones?", "answer": "Answer\nShure OEM microphone models were sold directly to other manufacturers who packaged these microphones with their products, such as tape recorders, two-way radios, or public address systems.

All mics in this demo use the same mic cartridge, thus sound differences are related only to the placement of the mic. \n "}, {"question": "What is the difference between Plug-In Power (Bias) and Phantom Power?", "answer": "Answer\nPhantom power is used with condenser microphones. It is called phantom power because there is no obvious external power supply for the condenser mic; the power supply is invisible and therefore a \"phantom.\" The mixer sends voltage up the same wires that the audio is traveling down. Thus, the microphone is receiving the power remotely from the mixer. Phantom power is used to power up the electronic preamp (also called an impedance converter) for professional condenser microphones.\nPhantom Power is 11 to 52 volts of DC power that rides on the same wires as the balanced audio signal.\nPlug in power is typically 5 volts of DC used to power up the JFET of inexpensive condenser microphones. The voltage can be on a separate conductor from the audio or ride on the same conductor as the audio.\nIn some condenser microphones, Plug-In Power (Bias) must be supplied on the same conductor as the audio signal. Condenser elements with a built in JFET use this configuration and employ a single conductor, shielded cable. \nOther condenser microphones use separate conductors for bias and audio. Make sure to consult the manufacturers spec sheet to get the exact configuration!\nA dynamic microphone should not be connected to an input that uses the same conductor for audio and bias (such as some wireless transmitters). It this happens, the frequency response of the mic may change and the signal can become distorted. If a dynamic microphone must be connected to an input with combined audio and bias, a blocking capacitor must be used. The blocking capacitor is placed in series with the \u201chot\u201d conductor of the microphone and will pass the audio that is present and block the bias voltage. The capacitor must have a high enough capacitance to pass the signal without degradation."}, {"question": "Are there general configuration instructions to use a managed network switch with Shure Dante-enabled products?", "answer": "Answer\nThe following guide is designed to help you configure your network switch for Dante and AES67 networks.

This translates as: the self-noise (hiss level) of the KSM44A is the equivalent of a sound source that measures 4 dB in Sound Pressure Level, A-weighted. In other words, if the KSM44A were placed in a room where there was \"no sound,\" the hiss level from the mic would equal the level of a really, really quiet sound source emitting 4 dB of sound pressure level.\n\nIn contrast, the Beta 98A has a higher noise floor of 30 dB SPL-A.  The hiss level of the Beta 98A would quite noticeable if compared to the hiss level of the KSM44A.  But can the higher noise level of the Beta 98A be a problem?   It would be if it were used to record quiet classical music or to record nature sounds in a forest.  But the Beta 98A was not developed for these uses; it was developed to mike drums and horns on a loud rock and roll stage.  In such a loud sound environment, the noise floor of the Beta 98A is not an issue - just like the noisy ventilation system was not a distraction during a rock concert. The performance advantage of the higher noise floor is a higher distortion point for the Beta 98A.  Give up noise floor on one end and the mic can handle higher sound pressure levels without distorting.  This is a good trade-off for a live sound microphone.\n\nSo where is a microphone with low noise floor an absolute requirement?  One example is \"Foley Recording.\"  Employed in the motion picture industry, Foley is the reproduction of everyday sound effects that are added to film in post-production to enhance the audio. These reproduced sounds can be anything from the swishing of clothing and footsteps to squeaky doors and breaking glass. Foley sound stages are exceptionally quiet and any microphone used must have a very low noise floor.  The KSM44A would qualify; the Beta 98A would not.\n\nCheck the noise floor specifications on inexpensive condenser microphones.  Did you find one that is under 10 dB SPL-A?  No? Why? Because it is expensive to develop, design, and manufacture a condenser microphone with a very low noise floor.  Less costs more.

Where can I get the driver?", "answer": "Answer\nThere is no external software driver for Motiv USB mics - they should be recognized by the computer's operating system as a generic USB Audio device. The Motiv microphones use the drivers that are already built-in to the operating system. If the computer is not recognizing the mic, please try a different USB port. Also, the mic might not work if going through a USB hub or dock extender. Also try using a different USB cable."}, {"question": "Will a Motiv product work with an Android device?", "answer": "Answer\nThe Motiv MV88 stereo mic has a Lightning connector and only works on iOS.\n\nOther Motiv products are designed to operate with a device that is USB Audio compliant.

So, is this true that they are the same connectors?", "answer": "Answer\n\nWhile the SRH1440 and SRH1840 headphones and SE earphones do use a MMCX connector, we do not recommend interchanging the cables. The plastic over molds were designed for the specific products and in some cases , the over mold may not fit into the receptacle. In other cases, it may fit but since the earphone cables use a formable wire for the ear, it may not be practical to use these cables for the headphones."}, {"question": "I'm creating a paging system and want to parallel wire multiple microphones into a single channel of my mixer. Is that ok?", "answer": "Answer\nWiring Microphones in Parallel\n  In music, recording, or conferencing applications, it is not recommended to parallel microphones into a single mixer input.\nIn paging applications, where the mics have mute switches and only a single mic is active at a time, connecting microphones in parallel allows more than one microphone to be connected to the same microphone input of a mixer. This reduces the cost and complexity of the paging system, since fewer mixers and microphone-to-mixer cables are required. There are tradeoffs, however:\nIt is not possible to adjust the level of one individual microphone. Therefore, individual soft or loud talkers cannot be accommodated.\nOnly dynamic microphones may be used. Condenser microphones requiring phantom power cannot be connected in parallel, because their cumulative current draw would exceed the capacity of most mixer inputs.\nIn Push-to-Talk applications, the switches on the microphones must be of the Normally Open type. If any microphone uses a Normally Closed switch, it will short out all of the microphones that are connected together and none of the mics will operate.\nIf two or more mics are activated at the same time, the output level of each mic will be less than if only one mic is activated.\nThe connection from each microphone to the audio cable leading to the mixer should be made inside of a shielded enclosure to prevent pickup of hum and interference. Passive 2-into-1 microphone combiners can be used, and provide transformer isolation between microphones.\nThe end of the cable that is farthest from the mixer input must be terminated with a resistor. The resistor produces no audio signal, but emulates the load presented by a microphone. This reduces pickup of hum and radio or electromagnetic interference when no mics are activated.\nAgain, make certain the microphones to be used have Normally Open switches for the mic circuit; some models have Normally Closed but can be modified to be Normally Open."}, {"question": "I have a R47XT cartridge that I would like to try and locate a stylus for.

"}, {"question": "I have a design where I need to bring in a couple of analog (wired or wireless) microphones in addition to using MXA microphones all to a P300. How can I set this up?", "answer": "Answer\nIf you have microphones that only have an analog output and you want to utilize the audio processing needed for proper conferencing, here's how you can make this work, especially if you also have additional (MXA) microphones as well contributing to the overall system.\n\nFirst, in Shure Designer, in the P300 configuration, you will want to take the analog input(s) and route this in the matrix mixer, to a dedicated Dante output(s). Next, route this Dante output(s) back in an unused Dante input(s) on the P300. This is essentially using the P300 as it's own A/D converter.\n\nNext, if these analog mics are to be reinforced in the room, you'll need to make sure that there are two different AEC ref signals established. One, a mix minus setup, where all inputs going to the loudspeakers with the exception of the analog inputs are routed to an additional unused Dante output. This Dante output is then selected as the AEC reference on the P300's AEC blocks. Then you will mult/take the output that is feeding the loudspeakers in the room (this is Dante output 1 by default on the P300), including the analog inputs and route this output into the AEC reference input in the MXA mic(s). Be sure to disable the AEC/NR/AGC block on the input channels on the P300 that the MXA mic(s) are going into.\n\nYou can also reference the images below to cross reference how this should be configured:\nDante routing\n\n\nP300 Schematic\n\n\nP300 Matrix Mixer settings\n "}, {"question": "Can you please provide guidance on how to properly update my ULX-D system to the latest firmware?", "answer": "Answer\nIMPORTANT: This document was updated in February, 2022 and supersedes all previous guidance. Please read this document before attempting to update firmware on ULX-D hardware.\n\nFirmware is embedded software in each component that controls functionality. Periodically, new versions of firmware are developed to incorporate additional features and enhancements. To take advantage of design improvements, new versions of the firmware can be uploaded and installed using the Shure Update Utility tool available on the Shure Update Utility page.\n\nWhen updating receiver firmware, update transmitters to the same firmware version to ensure consistent operation.\n\nThe firmware of all ULX-D devices has the form of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.2.14). At a minimum, all ULX-D devices on the network (including transmitters), must have the same MAJOR and MINOR firmware version numbers (e.g., 1.2.x).\n\nThe firmware update process is broken down into several steps. Depending on the status of the equipment, it may be necessary to execute only certain steps.\n\nIMPORTANT:  All receiver variants running firmware prior to 1.4.8 must be updated to 1.4.8 before updating to newer versions. Only ULXD4D and ULXD4Q receivers running firmware between 1.4.8 and 2.0.28 must be updated to 2.0.28 before updating to newer versions.\n\nStep 1: Connect to your receivers to your computer.\nConnect an Ethernet cable between your computer and the Primary network port on the receiver. If the receiver and computer are both set to Automatic (DHCP) mode, the devices will form a private network using link-local IP addresses in the 169.254.xxx.xxx range (subnet mask 255.255.0.0).\nMore advanced customers with static IP addresses or a local area network should verify that the Shure Control IP address on the receiver(s) and the computer are in the same IP address range.\nNote: We do not recommend \"daisy-chaining\" receivers when performing firmware updates simultaneously, or updating over WiFi, as connectivity might be lost during the update process. Use a network switch or update one receiver at a time.\nIf in doubt: just connect one receiver directly to your computer\u2019s Ethernet port, and factory-reset the receiver to ensure it is in a known state.\nStep 2: Install the latest version of Shure Update Utility (SUU) on your computer.\nDownload SUU from www.shure.com/firmware.\nUnzip the file, run the installer, and follow the installer\u2019s on-screen instructions. If you had a previous version of SUU installed, the installer will automatically uninstall it and replace it with the newer version.\nClose and re-open SUU to ensure it is running as the local user and not Administrator (Windows Only).\nClick Check for Updates or ### Updates Available at the top of the window. Download all updates available. This may take a few minutes.\nEnsure your receivers appear under the Update Devices\nIf they do not, see: Shure Update Utility: Devices Don't Display\nIf the devices all say Discovering, see: Shure Update Utility: Devices Appear as \"Discovering\"\nStep 3: Update ULXD4D Dual-Channel Receivers and ULXD4Q Quad-Channel Receivers\n\nImportant: Read over this procedure BEFORE clicking Send Updates.\nDetermine the current firmware version installed on your ULXD4D or ULXD4Q receiver.\nIn SUU, click on the Update Devices Look at each receiver\u2019s Current version column and make a note. Versions older than 2.0.28 require a special update procedure.\nYou can also determine the firmware version from the front panel with the instructions at the end of this article.\nIf the firmware version contains a star (e.g., 1.4.8*), or if you updated previously and the update failed, then follow the recovery procedure at the end of this document or contact Shure Applications Engineering.\nIf the receiver firmware version is earlier than 1.4.8, follow these steps.\nClick on the Update Devices Double-click the Version to install column next to the receiver firmware for each receiver and select 1.4.8.\nUnselect the checkbox next to the transmitter firmware for each receiver.

Follow these steps to update your ULXD1 and ULXD2 transmitters:\nConfirm that the associated ULX-D receiver is on the latest firmware version if you did not just update it.\nLocate a microphone stand or music stand on which you can place the transmitter so that it is 4\u201d \u2013 6\u201d from the receiver\u2019s IR port. It is very important that you keep the transmitter still during the update process to avoid an interruption, which can corrupt the firmware. We do not recommend holding the transmitter in your hands because the IR signal may get interrupted.\nPlace the handheld or bodypack transmitter on the stand you found in Step 2 and align the transmitter and receiver IR ports. The IR port on the transmitter should face the IR port on the receiver, about 4\" - 6\" away.\nBegin the update process. On the receiver, press ENTER, use knob to scroll to DEVICE UTILITIES, press ENTER, scroll to TX FW UPDATE, and press ENTER.\nWhen the two devices are aligned, the IR port on the receiver will illuminate red.\nPress ENTER on the receiver to begin the download to the transmitter. Do not move the transmitter. IR ports must be aligned for the entire download, which can take 50 seconds or longer.\nIf the update fails or if the ULXD1 or ULXD2 displays FPGA ERR! after installation, then repeat the update procedure ensuring the device is perfectly steady during the procedure. See ULX-D transmitter FPGA error for more information.\nStep 6: Update ULXD6 and ULXD8 transmitter firmware if it is running on an earlier version.\n\nIf possible, we recommend updating ULXD6 and ULXD8 transmitters using an SBC250, SBC450, or SBC850 Network Charging Station if you have one, though update via the IR port is possible.\n\nTo update a ULXD6 or ULXD8 via an SBC250, SBC450, or SBC850 Network Charging Station, follow these steps:\nConnect the SBC250, SCB450, or SBC850 to your computer or network.\nEnsure that the charger and all docked microphones appear in SUU.\nClick the check box adjacent to the charger(s) and microphone(s) to be updated.\nClick the Send Updates button. Do not turn off the chargers until the update is complete.\nIf the update fails, please re-attempt the update. Contact Shure Applications Engineering if the update does not complete successfully after a few tries.\nTo update a ULXD6 or ULXD8 via the IR port from a receiver, follow these steps:\nConfirm that the associated ULX-D receiver is on the latest firmware version if you did not just update it.\nLocate a music stand or other secure surface on which you can place the transmitter so it is 4\u201d \u2013 6\u201d from the receiver\u2019s IR port. It is very important that you keep the transmitter still during the update process to avoid an interruption, which can corrupt the firmware. We do not recommend holding the transmitter in your hands because the IR signal may get interrupted.\nPlace the ULXD6 or ULXD8 on the surface you found, and align the transmitter and receiver IR ports. The IR port on the transmitter should face the IR port on the receiver, about 4\" - 6\" away.\nBegin the update process. On the receiver, press ENTER, use knob to scroll to DEVICE UTILITIES, press ENTER, scroll to TX FW UPDATE, and press ENTER.\nWhen the two are aligned, the IR port on the receiver will illuminate red.\nPress ENTER on the receiver to begin the download to the transmitter.

"}, {"question": "How do I set up remote antennas for my Axient Digital, BLX4R, ULX, QLXD, ULXD or SLX-D wireless system?", "answer": "Answer\nRemote Antennas for UHF Wireless Microphones\nClick here for an online remote antenna tool.\nAntennas are described in terms of the signal wavelength they are designed to pick up. The antenna supplied with Shure QLX-D, ULX-D, and Axient Digital wireless systems is a \"1/2-wave\", meaning that it is about 1/2 of the length of the radio wave being received. The BLX4R, SLX-D and ULX Standard system comes with 1/4-wave antennas. A 1/4 wave antenna uses the receiver chassis as part of the antenna; therefore a 1/4 wave antenna must not be remote mounted.\nFor good performance, the following guidelines should be observed when remote mounting antennas:\nPlace antennas properly. Antennas should be mounted away from large metal objects or surfaces, which cause reflections that can reduce signal strength. Antennas should also be kept away from sources of RF energy, such as computers, digital devices, AC power equipment, etc. For best diversity performance, antennas should by placed from 1/2-wavelength to 1 full wavelength apart (1 to 2 feet for UHF). Wider separation between antennas does not offer significant benefit, except when mounting at opposite sides of a very large stage, for example. For diversity wireless systems, both antennas must be located in the performance area, and connected to the receiver via separate coaxial cables.\nUse the appropriate antenna cable. For proper performance, the impedance of the cable should match the impedance of the antenna input on the receiver (50 Ohms for Shure receivers). An impedance mismatch causes some of the signal to be reflected back into the cable, resulting in a reduction of signal level. Different types of cable are rated according to the amount of signal loss over a specified length (usually 100 feet). These ratings are specific to the frequency range of the signal being passed (VHF or UHF). The maximum length of cable is dictated by how much the antenna amplifier can boost the signal. See the section on antenna amplifiers. It is not necessary for both antennas on a diversity receiver to be connected to identical lengths of cable; ideally, each antenna should be connected to the minimum length of cable necessary to reach the receiver. The following table describes the maximum length of cable that should be used between a UHF antenna and a receiver input. If antenna boosters are used, the cable length can usually be longer depending on how much gain the booster provides. For example, using a booster that provides 10dB of gain, and following the cable loses specified on the table, you could run 108 ft. of RG8X/U. Note: the UA834 antenna amplifier can only be connected to the AD4D, AD4Q, UR4S, UR4D, ULXS4, ULXP4, ULXD4, ULXD4D, ULXD4Q, UA844 or UA845. The UA834 will not work connected directly to a BLX4R, QLXD4, SLXD4, or SLXD4D receiver.\nUHF Antenna Cable Loss Per 100 Feet\nCable Length from Antenna to Receiver Cable Type Signal Loss @ 800 MHz per 100 ft.\nUp to 25 feet\nRG-8X/U (Belden 9258, or similar)\n(Plenum: Times Microwave LMR-240-LLPL)\n~12 dB per 100 ft.\nUp to 40 feet RG-213/U (Belden 8367 or similar)\nor Times Microwave LMR-240 ~7 dB per 100 ft.\nUp to 75 feet\nRG-8/U (Belden 7810A or similar)\n(RG-8/U loss can vary manufacturer to manufacturer)\n~3.7 dB or more per 100 ft.\nUp to 300 feet Times Microwave LMR-400 or Belden 9913\n(Plenum, for permanent installation only:\nBelden 89913, Times Microwave LMT-400-LLPL) ~3.5 dB per 100 ft.\nOver 300 feet Commscope LDF4-50A\n(for permanent installation only! This cable is very stiff and requires jumpers at each end to connect to equipment.) ~1.7 dB per 100 ft\nMinimize the number of connection points. Each connection between two sections of cable results in some additional signal loss. Use one continuous length of cable to go from the antenna to the receiver. If antenna amplifiers are being used, mount the antenna directly on the input of the first amplifier, use one length of cable to go from the amplifier to a second antenna amplifier (if needed), and from the second antenna amplifier to the receiver. For very stiff cable (LMR-400 and thicker) it can be advantageous to terminate the cable in N-Female connectors, and use a small jumper cable that has an N-Male connector on one end to a BNC-Male on the other end.\nUse an antenna amplifier to compensate for cable losses. For long cable runs, an antenna amplifier such as the UA834 can be used at the antenna to boost signal level. Up to two UA834's may be used (one located at the antenna, and one in the middle of the cable run) permitting total cable runs of up to 500 feet when the appropriate type of coaxial cable is used. If a cable run longer than 500 feet is called for, it is better to locate the entire receiver closer to the performance area, and run a long audio cable to the mixing console. A long audio cable (balanced and line level) is much less likely to pick up interference than a long antenna cable. (Note: the BLX4R, QLXD4, and the SLXD4 receiver do not supply DC power to operate the UA834 or UA874.)\nNo more than two UA834 antenna amplifiers can be used in one antenna line. This restriction is due to increasing noise due to the amount of gain being added to the signal, and to the limited amount of current that the receivers or antenna distribution amplifier can supply at their antenna inputs. This current is used to power the UA834, eliminating the need for a separate power supply. It is always preferable to use lower loss cables and fewer amplifiers than to try to compensate for higher loss cable."}, {"question": "Can I assign a fixed / static IP address to the Stem Wall, Stem Ceiling, or Stem Table?", "answer": "Answer\nYes, you can assign a static IP to all Stem devices with the exception of the Stem Control. However, where possible, it is recommended to assign a MAC address reservation via the DHCP server to make sure that a unit will always be at the expected network address if you want your Stem devices to have specific IP addresses.\n\nYou also have the option to let your Stem devices fall back to a link-local IP address (firmware 2.7.0.0 and higher).

Why?", "answer": "Answer\nWhat you are describing is known as proximity effect. With any unidirectional microphone, speaking closer to the mic will result in more low-end. Speaking directly into the front of the mic will produce the deep sound that is typically associated with radio broadcasters. When using the mic at a distance, we recommend using the Auto Level feature in the Far Mode setting in the MOTIV Desktop app. To add some extra low-end, try using the Dark tone setting. Be sure that the mic is pointed directly at your mouth.\n\nThe sound of your room will also have an effect on your mic's tone, especially when speaking at a distance. Adding more absorptive materials to the room may help.\n\nFor more information, please see:\nThree Ways to Use Your Shure MV7 Podcast Microphone: https://youtu.be/gl7Ly4mwwVU\nWhy does Proximity Effect Occur?"}, {"question": "Why is my MV7's output level so low? ", "answer": "Answer\nIt's normal for the MV7 to have a low output level. It's an insensitive microphone and is designed such. It is ideally used very close up - this is what gives it such great isolation and also gives it it's signature sound. Don't be afraid to get your mouth literally right up next to the windscreen, particularly if you're speaking in a medium to quiet voice. If you look at photos or videos of radio DJs using the SM7B, which the MV7 was modeled after, you will notice them speaking extremely close to the mic.\n\nThe MV7 is a dynamic microphone, and dynamic mics typically have a lower output when compared to condenser microphones. \n\nDynamic mics are passive, being driven only by the sound (literally moving air particles) around it. Plus, there's a relatively large mass in the mic to be moved by these sound waves. Condensers are active, and are electrically powered. They \"listen\" more attentively to the environment and have lighter moving parts. Condenser mics tend to pick up more of the surrounding environment, where dynamics won't, as they're less sensitive.\n\nIf you find that the MV7 isn't working for your particular application, you may want to consider trying a condenser USB microphone like the MV5, MV5C, or MV51.\n\nFor more information about these two types of microphones, please see Difference between a dynamic and condenser microphone."}, {"question": "What are the differences between the SE846 Gen 1 and Gen 2 models?", "answer": "Answer\nThe SE846 Gen 1 earphones came with three sound signature filters: \"balanced\", \"warm\", and \"bright\".

What is the best way to do that?", "answer": "Answer\nThe SM7B is an analog microphone, and it does not communicate with your computer digitally. In fact, there are no active components inside the SM7B. Therefore, you will need an audio interface to use the SM7B with a computer, tablet, or phone.\n\nThe Shure Motiv MVi audio interface is a great way to connect an SM7B to a Mac, PC, iOS Device, or Android device. The MVi features 56 dB of total gain with the 20 dB Boost enabled*, which is generally enough for all but the quietest SM7B users. If you require more gain than that, you may need an external phantom-powered pre-amp to put between the SM7B and the MVi, or a different audio interface altogether. Take a look at SM7B Output Level and Preamp Gain Specifications for some suggestions.\n\n*The 20 dB Boost on the MVi can only be enabled via the MOTIV Audio or MOTIV Video app on a mobile device. iPhone users will need an AMV-LTG micro-B to lightning cable.\n\nTo get studio quality sound, be sure to mount the SM7B on a sturdy microphone stand or boom arm. See SM7B and MV7: How to Mount for some ideas. Use the mic in a room with lots of soft fabrics and cushions to reduce echo, and speak very close to the mic (your lips should be brushing the windscreen). One common trick is to run a long mic cable from a computer into a walk-in closet full of clothing, which will deaden the sound around you.\n\nSome users with older computers and no USB sound card may want to use the Shure A96F Camcorder Kit to connect the SM7B to the analog input of a PC. The sound quality will not be as good as with a digital interface like the MVi, but it may work for your applications. If your computer has a microphone input, you should be able to plug the A96F into it without any problem. The A96F will not supply enough additional gain for the line input of a computer. You would need to purchase a mic to line amplifier to use the line input (also called a preamp).\n\nFor more information on transformers and their uses see Transformers - When to use and how does it work?\n\nPlease note: When using the SM7B with a computer, look for and select your audio interface in your computer or device's Sound Settings or Control Panel. The SM7B will not appear in the list as it is analog.

If you need a Micro-B to Lightning cable for your MVi, MV5, or MV51, purchase an AMV-LTG cable, which is 1 meter in length."}, {"question": "My MV7 is picking up background noise. Doesn't it have Voice Isolation Technology?", "answer": "Answer\nVoice Isolation Technology refers to the cardioid pickup pattern of the microphone, which picks up sounds best from the front and rejects sounds from the sides and rear. There is no digital background noise removal in the microphone or MOTIV Desktop app.\n\nThe MV7, like any microphone, will \"hear\" whatever is in its pickup area. For best results, maximize the level of the intended source (your voice) in relation to unwanted sound (background noise) by speaking as close as possible to the microphone, and orient the microphone away from the unwanted noise.\n\nTo learn more about cardioid and other polar patterns, please see our online publication, \"Microphone Techniques for Music -- Sound Reinforcement\".\n\nA properly sound-treated room will also go a long way toward minimizing background noise. Simply adding more absorptive materials, and removing reflective materials, will help.\n\nYou can also consider using a noise gate in your DAW (for recording), or in a virtual audio mixing/routing software such as Voicemeeter (for streaming). A noise gate will keep your mic muted until the input level reaches a threshold that you set. This is very helpful for recording or streaming in noisy environments."}, {"question": "Can I use Shure True Wireless adapters with earphones from other manufacturers?", "answer": "Answer\nOther manufacturers might use MMCX connectors with different tolerances, so the fit may be too loose or too tight.

Either side can be used for phone calls.  \n\n\nHow long does the battery last? \n\nUp to 8 hours of battery life. (Listening to AAC Audio at Max volume with Environment Mode ON). \nThe Included carrying case provides three additional charges for a total of up to 32 hours battery life. \nA user may get longer (up to 10hrs) listening at less than Max Volume and/or without ENV mode. \nAptX at 100db SPL (Env mode Off) should get about 8 hours. \nStandby time is about 35 hours (powered on but not in use). \n\nHow quickly can I recharge the Earphones? \n\nFifteen minutes of charge will get you about 1 hour of use.  \n\nTwo hours of charge gets you from 0% to 100% full battery. \n\n \n\nHow many charges are in the case? \n\nThe included carrying case provides three additional charges for a total of up to 32 hours battery life.  If the battery is fully charged it will retain charge for up to a year. \n\n \nHow long does it take to recharge the case?  \n\nAbout two hours. \n\n\nWhy does the TW2 case have a sticker that says \u201cRMCE-TW1\u201d? Does this mean I have an older generation? \n\n\nThe second-generation versions of the Shure AONIC 215 True Wireless Sound Isolating Earphones (SE215-TW2) and True Wireless Secure Fit Adapter (RMCE-TW2) share the same regulatory name with their predecessors (RMCE-TW1). We are required to include the regulatory name on products, so you might see \u201cRMCE-TW1\u201d text included in certain areas of labelling on the new Gen 2 TW2 products. \n\nYou can quickly determine which generation you have by looking at the date code printed on the interior of the adapters - located near the \u201cL\u201d and \u201dR\u201d of the control button, just under the small Shure logo. The second-generation versions (TW2) include an underline on this date code, while the first generation (TW1) versions do not.  Additionally, you can confirm the generation by connecting your product to the ShurePlus PLAY app (available for free in the Google Play and Apple app stores). We realize this can be confusing and appreciate your understanding of this regulatory requirement. \n\n \n\nHow can I tell if I have a first generation or second-generation version of the AONIC 215 True Wireless Earphones?   \n\nYou can quickly determine which generation you have by looking at the date code printed on the interior of the adapters - located near the \u201cL\u201d and \u201dR\u201d of the control button, just under the small Shure logo.

How do I know the earphones are inserted properly in the case? Why does the LED inside the case not light up when I insert my earphones?  \n\nFor proper charging, insert the earphones fully into the case until the top case LED turns solid Red. You can also see the LEDs illuminate through the LED side ports when it is unzippered. \n\n \n\nWhat do the lights on the case mean?  \n\nBottom:  \nThe 3 white LEDs on the bottom of the case indicate how many charges are remaining in the case. Pushing the button will give you the case charge remaining status. The case LEDs will stay on if the case is plugged into a power supply. \n\nTop:  \nThe Red/Green LED inside the top of the case will light up Red when a unit is placed in the case. It will stay Red if either module is charging. Once both modules are fully charged, it will turn Green for 5 minutes, and then turn off. \n\n \n\nWhat do the adapter LEDs mean? \nFlashing Blue and Red = Pairing Mode \nFlashing Red = Low Battery \n1s Single Blue Flash = Power On\n1s Single Red Flash = Power Off \nSolid Red LED when in case = Charging \n1s Repeated Blue Flash = Link Loss (Primary adapter has lost contact with host) \nSolid Red during phone call = On A Call (configurable in PLAY app) \n\nHow do I know which side is the Primary? (The Active Mic for Phone Calls) \n\nAlthough you hear call audio in both ears, only one side sends the audio from your end of a phone call. That side - known as the \u201cPrimary\u201d - is identified in the ShurePlus PLAY App. \n\nTo configure which side is the Primary, choose the side you prefer for phone calls, and power on/remove that side from the case first.    \n\nThe first adapter that the phone/computer \u201csees\u201d will become the Primary for that session only. That adapter will remain the Primary until any one of the following events occur: \nThe unit is returned to the Charging Case.  \nThe unit is powered OFF (via long-press of the adapter\u2019s multi-function button). \nThe unit goes out of RF range of the host (e.g., your phone or PC). \nThe unit powers OFF automatically due to a Low Battery condition. \nWhen any of those events occur, the Secondary unit (if present) will take over from the Primary. \n\nThe Mute tone (triple press during a phone call) will only be heard in the Primary. \n\nHow do I clear the PDL (Paired Device List)?  \n\nYou can clear from the PLAY app or put both adapters in case and hold down buttons for 7 seconds. \n\nHow do I peer pair a replacement adapter? \n\nThe peer pairing process wirelessly pairs one adapter to another so that they work as a set. To pair your new adapter to your old adapter, put both adapters in the charging case and hold down the adapter buttons for 7 seconds, until the adapter LEDs begin flashing blue. To see the Adapter LEDs, look through the LED port on the side of the case. \n\n\nIf I lose a unit and receive a replacement, how do I pair it to my other adapter?  \n\nTo peer pair, put both adapters in case and hold down buttons for 7 seconds. This also clears the PDL. Once you have peer-paired the modules to each other, be sure to use the PLAY app to update the firmware so that the new and old earbuds are both running on the same firmware. \n\n\nWhy are my device settings \u201cgrayed out\u201d in the PLAY app? Why can\u2019t I change settings? \n\nIf you are only using one earbud, you will not be able to change system settings like Pause Plus or Environment Mode. System changes are only allowed when both earbuds are \u201cseen\u201d by the host. Likewise, both earbuds must be on the same firmware version. If Right and Left are on different firmware versions, the PLAY app will disable any of the customization options. \n\nIf I lose the charging case and buy a new one, do I need to pair it up with the original adapters?  \n\nNo.  \n\nWhy does it keep going into pairing mode?  \n\nIf you continue to press on the Right adapter after you hear the \u201cPower On\u201d prompt, you will enter into Bluetooth Pairing Mode. It is important to release the button after you hear the \u201cPower On\u201d prompt unless you want to enter Bluetooth Pairing Mode. \n\n \nWhat should I do if I\u2019m having music playback issues through one of the earphones, or if I only hear \"Power On\" in one of the earphones?\n\nTry turning the units off and back on again. If that does not work, download the ShurePlus PLAY app (available on Shure.com, the Apple App store and Google Play store) and update the firmware to version 7.5 or later.  \n\nWhy are my AONIC 215 earphones not loud enough? \n\nDownload the 2.1 version of the ShurePlus PLAY app (available on Shure.com, the Apple App store and Google Play store) and update the firmware to version 7.5 or later.   \n\nThere is a new feature that lets you select your earphone for the best listening experience. \n\nHow many microphones are there in the True Wireless Secure Fit Adapter? \n\nThere are two microphones on each module. On each there is one mic for Voice and one mic for Environment Mode. They work together in conjunction with DSP (\u201cbeamforming\u201d) to improve voice intelligibility. \n\n Can I use the Secure Fit Adapter with other MMCX earphones? \n\nShure designed this system to work with its line of MMCX earphones. Compatibility with other earphones is not guaranteed; and performance is dependent on impedance and other characteristics of the earphones.\n\n\nWhat Bluetooth profiles are supported?  \n\nA2DP 1.3, AVRCP 1.6, GAVDP 1.3, HFP 1.7, HSP 1.2 \n\n\nDoes this product support role swapping? \n\nYes. Either Left or Right side can be the Primary (the Primary unit is the side that \u201ctalks\u201d to the phone). When you remove them from the case, the first one the phone \u201csees\u201d will become the Primary. It will remain the Primary until you put it back in the Charging Case, or it goes out of range, or the battery dies. If either event occurs, the Secondary will automatically take over and become the Primary.  \n \n\nIs there Multipoint Pairing? \n\nMultipoint pairing is not supported by True Wireless. \n\nHow many devices can it store in memory?  \n\nUp to 8. The oldest will be overwritten by the newest. \n\n \nHow do I reset to factory defaults? \n\nYou can reset by using the ShurePlus PLAY app. \n\n\nTell me about Environment Mode \n\nEnvironment Mode allows you to hear the outside world with the touch of a button. If you cup your adapter in your hand while Environment Mode is On, the unit may produce feedback (howling). Sometimes this may cause the unit to shut down, but it will not damage the earphone. \n\nSetting Earphone Model in the App (\u201cEarphones Connected\u201d)  \n\nSelect the correct model for best performance. Selecting an incorrect model may result in sub-optimal performance issues including insufficient output or overload shutdown.  \n\nWhat is Overload Shutdown? \n\n An overload shutdown protects the battery circuit from damage. If you experience an overload shutdown it may be necessary to return the units to the charging case before they power on again. \n\n \nWhat are the battery specifications?   \n\nLi-ion coin cell = 2.4g (85mAh, 4.2V at full charge) \n\n\nIs TW2 MS Teams Certified? \n\nNo. TW2 is not UC or MS Teams certified. \n "}, {"question": "What is the network port info for Shure products?", "answer": "Answer\nClick here for a document that details the following information for all networkable Shure products.

Is that to be expected?", "answer": "Answer\nWhen an ADX1 or ADX2 transmitter first powers on, it is performing several startup functions, including looking for a ShowLink access point (AXT610 or AD610). These startup functions cause varying current draw on the battery. When there is no ShowLink access point in the system, these functions can take longer to complete. The battery life algorithms in the transmitter can thus take longer to converge and display the estimated run time. In some instances, it could take several minutes for the algorithm to converge."}, {"question": "Can I get a longer cable for my Motiv Mic?", "answer": "Answer\nThis information applies to the MV5, MV5C, MV51, MVi, MV7, and MV88+.

{"question": "Why does one of my Aonic TW1 or TW2 True Wireless adapters lose charge faster than the other?", "answer": "Answer\nWhichever adapter is taken out of the charging case and makes a connection with your phone first will be designated as the 'primary' adapter. The primary adapter will use a bit more battery power than the secondary because the Bluetooth signal travels first to the primary, then to the secondary. The primary adapter will also be the unit which serves as the microphone for phone calls, which will further drain its battery. But, you should still expect around eight hours of run time from a full charge if using the AAC codec. AptX will drain the battery faster. Android devices will tend to drain the battery faster because they default to the highest quality audio codec available, while iOS uses the more efficient AAC codec. Android customers can select a different codec in Developer Options, if they choose to.\n\nIf you are in the habit of removing one adapter from the charging case first, try switching to the other adapter occasionally so that you are not draining the battery on one adapter more frequently than the other. This may increase the overall life of the adapters."}, {"question": "Please recommend a carrying case for the BLX88 dual wireless system.", "answer": "Answer\nWe recommend contacting a case company, such as Gator Cases.

The problem goes away when I reboot until I touch the device to mute it again. How do I fix this?", "answer": "Answer\nThis typically happens when a third-party control system begins \"chasing its tail\"--that is, it responds to the commands it sends, causing it to mute and unmute the mics endlessly.\n\nThe recommended way to avoid this is to program your control system as follows:\nOn the control system, watch for the < REP MUTE_BUTTON_STATUS ON > string. The MXA-MUTE sends out this command when the button is pushed.\nWhen that string is received, send a mute command to the DSP, to toggle the mute status.\nWait for confirmation from the DSP that the mute status has been changed.\nSend < SET DEV_LED_IN_STATE OFF > or < SET DEV_LED_IN_STATE ON > command to the MXA-MUTE to change the LED color.\nHere is a screenshot of Crestron SIMPL Debugger:\n\n\nThis should resolve the issue."}, {"question": "What is the difference between the regular and Pro version of Shure SE earphones?", "answer": "Answer\nThe earphones in the two packages are identical.

Impedance is similar to resistance which is how much a device resists the flow of a DC signal. Both impedance and resistance are measured in ohms, the symbol for which is '\u03a9'.\n\nWhat is the difference between low, medium, and high impedance?\n\nWhen referring to microphones, low impedance is less than 600\u03a9; medium impedance is 600\u03a9 to 10,000\u03a9; high impedance is greater than 10,000\u03a9.\n\nFor audio circuits, is it important to match impedance?\n\nNot any more. In the early part of the 20th century, it was important to match impedance. Bell Laboratories found that to achieve maximum power transfer in long distance telephone circuits, the impedances of different devices should be matched. Impedance matching reduced the number of vacuum tube amplifiers needed, which were expensive, bulky, and heat producing.\n\nIn 1948, Bell Laboratories invented the transistor, a cheap, small, efficient amplifier. The transistor utilizes maximum voltage transfer more efficiently than maximum power transfer. For maximum voltage transfer, the destination device (called the \"load\") should have an impedance of at least ten times that of the sending device (called the \"source\"). This is known as BRIDGING. Bridging is the most common circuit configuration when connecting audio devices. With modern audio circuits, matching impedances can actually degrade audio performance.\n\nAre low impedance mixer inputs really low impedance?\n\nAudio mixers often have inputs labeled as \"low impedance\". Actually, these inputs have impedances between 1000\u03a9 and 2000\u03a9 in order to properly bridge the low impedance microphone. A low impedance microphone may always be connected to an input with a higher impedance. However, the microphone may not always be able to provide enough signal strength to properly drive the mixer's audio input. Always compare the microphone's output level (or sensitivity) to the required mixer input level.\n\nWhat happens when a high impedance microphone is connected to a low impedance input?\n\nWhen a microphone is connected to a mixer input with lower impedance, there will be some loss of the microphone signal. To determine the amount of signal loss (or \"load loss\") in dB, use the following equation:\nRsource is the actual microphone impedance. Rload is the actual mixer input impedance.\nAs a rule of thumb, a loss of 3.5 dB or less is acceptable"}, {"question": "How do I update the firmware on my GLX-D system?", "answer": "Answer\nPlease Note: GLXD4 and GLXD6 receivers and GLXD1/GLXD2 transmitters cannot be updated with Mac computers featuring USB-C connectors, Mac Computers featuring a \"touchbar\", or on Mac computers running OS 10.14 or newer. Please use a Windows computer or a Mac without those features. \n\nPlease note: You must use Shure Update Utility 2.4.8 to update GLX-D. SUU 2.5.0 and later does not support GLX-D.\n\nIf the blue RF light is blinking and there is no audio, or if you cannot access Group 4, you will need to update your components to the latest firmware. Follow these steps:\nDownload Shure Update Utility 2.4.8 from the Shure web site (note: version 2.5.0 or later will not update GLX-D).\nInstall the Shure Update Utility and open the Shure Update Utility.\nClick on the \"Tools\" menu at the top of the screen.\nSelect \"Check for Updates\" or \"### Updates Available\" and download all updates for GLX-D.\nSelect the \"Firmware\" tab and confirm the version 2.2.6.0 or later is listed for GLX-D wireless components (screenshot shows 2.0.0.1, but 2.2.6.0 is the latest at time of writing).\n Using the USB to Micro USB cable supplied with your GLX-D system, connect your GLX-D receiver to your computer. Note that \"charge-only\" USB A to USB Micro-B cables will not allow for updates.\nOn the GLXD4 receiver, the Micro USB plug is located on the right side of the rear panel as shown below (#13).\nOn the GLXD6 receiver the Micro USB port is located next to the audio output jack as shown below (#4).\nIf your receiver is not already powered on, power on your receiver. You will see this:\nClick the \"SEND UPDATES...\" button to send the latest firmware to your receiver. After about 2 minutes you will receive this message:\nClose this window and repeat steps 3 - 5 above for your GLX-D transmitter.\nOn the GLXD2 handheld microphone, unscrew the bottom half of the handle to expose the Micro USB connector as shown below (#5).\nOn the GLXD1 bodypack transmitter open the rubber flap on the side of the transmitter to expose the Micro USB connector as shown below (#5).\n Turn on your receiver and transmitter and wait a few seconds for the two to link.\nNow both of your components are using the latest firmware and should function normally."}, {"question": "How did Phantom Power get its name?", "answer": "Answer\n\nBecause there are no additional wires to provide the phantom voltage. The same cable is used to carry the mic signal to the mixer, and to carry the phantom voltage from the mixer to the mic. One cable is used as a \"two-way street\". Early condenser mic designs used additional wires to deliver the operational power. Thus the method to deliver phantom voltage is unseen, i.e., a \"phantom\" method.\n\nActually, the correct technical term is \"simplex power\"; phantom power is an early recording studio \"nickname\" for this type of voltage delivery system, and the nickname stuck."}, {"question": "What information can you provide about the 600 MHz incentive auction?", "answer": "Answer\nIn the United States, wireless microphone and PSM systems which are capable of transmitting between 616-653 MHz and 663-698 MHz are no longer legal to buy, use, or sell after July 13, 2020. To determine if your system is still legal to operate or sell, please consult What Wireless Frequency Bands are Legal to Use in the United States?\n\nBackground\nCongress directed the FCC in 2012 to reallocate some of the UHF TV Spectrum for use by broadband wireless devices, such as smart phones. Unlike the 700 MHz auction in 2008, the 600 MHz incentive auction offered broadcasters an opportunity to voluntarily give up spectrum in return for a share of the auction proceeds, hence the term \u201cincentive auction.\u201d This auction is sometimes referred to as the \u201c600 MHz Auction\u201d because the frequencies offered at auction started at 698 MHz (the former top-end of the UHF TV band) and moved down from there. The auction started in 2016. After four stages, supply met demand with a reallocation of 84 MHz of total spectrum (614-698 MHz, or TV channels 37 to 51). TV stations electing to continue operations were \u201cre-packed\u201d into channels below TV channel 37, making the UHF TV band smaller and much more crowded. The re-pack ended in July of 2020. More information from the FCC can be found on their website.\n  How did the Incentive Auction work?\nThe Incentive Auction consisted of several sequential phases: the reverse auction, forward auction, and spectrum re-pack. In the reverse auction phase, broadcasters that had elected to participate submitted an exit price for relinquishing their spectrum assignment. The level of participation in this phase determined how much spectrum is available for auction and its corresponding valuation. These figures were also known as the clearing target and clearing cost. After the reverse auction, the buyers (such as, AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, Dish, T-Mobile, etc.) bid on the available spectrum during the forward auction. If the dollar amount generated during the forward auction was less than that of the reverse auction, the process repeated. This sequence of reverse and forward auctions is known as a \u201cstage.\u201d After four stages that began March 2016 and ran through January 2017, the dollar amount generated in the forward auction exceeded that of the reverse auction.\nSince Stage 4 of the auction was successful, a new UHF band plan was issued and work began to repack the UHF TV spectrum. Once the band plan was made public, the clock started on a 39-month transition. During this time, broadcasters moved to their new TV channel assignments, and the auction winners began building out their new services. Once a new service commenced operation in a particular area, wireless microphones that operated in the spectrum between 616-653 MHz and 663-698 MHz could no longer be used, making this a rolling transition on a city by city basis. The entire repacking process was completed on July 13, 2020, after which time no wireless microphones may legally operate in any of the auctioned spectrum, regardless of its level of occupancy.\nHow will the Incentive Auction affect my wireless systems?\nYou are no longer be allowed to operate wireless systems which can transmit between 616-653 MHz and 663-698 MHz. See What Wireless Frequency Bands are Legal to Use in the United States? to determine if your equipment is affected.\n\nThe FCC successfully auctioned 84 MHz of UHF spectrum. 70 MHz of this spectrum was reallocated to mobile broadband services. A 2 MHz band and an 11 MHz band will be used as a guard band and a duplex gap band. During the 39-month transition period, if you owned wireless microphone systems that operate in auctioned spectrum (616-653 MHz and 663-698 MHz), it was your responsibility not to interfere with new services once they begin operation. At the conclusion of the transition period (July 13, 2020), operation of wireless microphones in the auction spectrum became illegal. Equipment owners are advised to confirm the operating frequency range of their systems and comply with the new rules of operation during and after the transition period. It is worth noting that 653 MHz through 663 MHz will still be available for wireless microphone operation, with some restrictions, during and after the transition period.

Many parameters controlled through the web application can be controlled through a third party control system, using the appropriate command string. A complete list of command strings for the MXA910 is available on shure.com, in the device help, or in the User's Guide.\n\nWhen using the MXA910 with a DSP, the microphone\u2019s LED status can be changed independently of the audio. Dante / AES67 audio will still flow to your DSP when using the following command strings.\n\nNote: This is useful when audio must always flow to the DSP, especially when AEC or other signal dependent processing is applied.\n\nInitial Setup\nConnect to the MXA910 from your third party control system (or telnet) using the MXA910\u2019s control IP address and TCP port 2202. If using a control system, be sure to leave the socket open as opposed to closing it after each command.

But, will that high SPL level damage the condensor mic?", "answer": "Answer\nIf the microphone is externally biased, and the diaphragm were to be displaced enough so that it was close enough to touch the backplate, AND there was not an insulating layer on the backplate, there would be a short circuit situation with a high voltage and thus a high current (spark) that would damage the diaphragm.\n\nIn Shure's externally biased mics, such as the KSM44A, SM27, Beta 27, and KSM42, we laminate a layer of Teflon on to the backplate to act as a barrier to prevent metal-to-metal contact between the diaphragm and backplate. Thus, even if the diaphragm slammed against with backplate, there is no diaphragm damage. Without the Teflon layer, there is sparking and diaphragm burn spots.\n\nActually, the diaphragm wouldn\u2019t even need to touch the bare backplate. It would just need to get close enough so the external bias caused dielectric breakdown through the air-gap (like lightening). \n\nSo if someone has an externally-biased mic with a bare metal backplate and the diaphragm gets displaced enough so that it either touches the metal backplate or comes closed enough for dielectric breakdown, there could be some damage and failure.

One of the attendees asked about the polarization of the UR2, ULXD, Axient handheld TX units and I was stumped. So, is the TX Polarization LHCP, RHCP, or both, on UR2, ULXD, Axient handheld units?", "answer": "Answer\nUnfortunately, there is probably not a clear answer to your question.  \n\nWireless microphone transmitters use all sorts of schemes for antennas. In addition, the transmitters, and hence the antennas, are generally not stationary\u2014they are constantly moving with a presenter or artist. Because of aesthetics, antennas are often compromised and shaped to be smaller than ideal, while still radiating a decent and usable signal.  \n\nFor bodypack transmitters, it is fairly common to use a 1/4 wave whip antenna. The radiated signal can be generally characterized as linearly polarized in the plane of the antenna, which is often times, but not always vertical\u2014depending on how the transmitter is worn or attached.\n\nHandheld microphones usually employ some sort of reduced size antenna. Because of this, the polarization is more or less linear, but the plane is essentially random and constantly changing with movement. The antennas can be considered radiating approximately an omnidirectional signal to accommodate motion.\n\nAs a note, several common schemes for wireless handheld microphone antennas are:\n1/4 wave spike, often shortened by loading\u2014not as common as in the past.\n1/4 wave element circularly wrapped\u2014essentially a shortened or compact 1/4 wave antenna - used in several Shure products like the UR2 and ULXD2. Polarization is probably best described as random due to motion.\nRF coupled to batteries in handle to act as the antenna.  Polarization probably completely unpredictable and random.\n\nOn top of these issues, body absorption is a major factor, especially effecting the signal from a belt work bodypack type transmitter. Handheld microphones tend to fare better in the body absorption realm, but can be compromised if a user/artist holds the microphone by portion of the handle where the antenna is located.\n\nTo overcome polarization issues, diversity linear polarization type antennas, such as dipoles and log-periodic-directional antennas, are often mounted to be 90 degrees opposite each other (45 degrees off vertical in opposite directions). Sometimes circularly polarized helical antennas are used to help compensate for randomly polarized inbound signals. However, helical antennas tend to be very directional, and are often not a good choice for shorter transmission distances due to excessive gain.\n\nFor link budget calculations, it is probably not too far off to assume the typical wireless microphone antenna's gain is somewhere between 0 to -3 dBd. Then be sure to add some margin into the link calculations - say 10 dB - to cover any path anomalies.\n\nDr. Mark Kenkel of Shure, who was deeply involved with the design and development of the UR2 helical transmit antenna, adds the following:\n\nThe helical in the UR-2 is considered a \u201cnormal mode helical antenna\u201d so the maximum radiation is normal (90 degrees) to the axis of the helix. Small antennas like this are generally linearly polarized. Ours is also primarily linearly polarized. Circular polarization is possible with small antennas like this but only over a very small frequency range with the proper internal construction. The HA8089 helical is an \u201caxial-mode helical antenna\u201d so radiation is maximum along the axis of the helix. This type of antenna can easily be made to have circular polarization over a wide frequency range. Left- or right-hand polarization is determined by the direction of helical windings much like the threads of a screw. I believe the antenna is available in both left- and right-hand configurations. When using two HA8089 antennas in a point-to-point application it is important to use two of the same type: Left and Left, or Right and Right, pointed at each other. The HA8089 has about 7 dBi of directional gain. When used with a UR2, 3 dB will be lost due to polarization mismatch. That is not necessarily a bad thing. The HA8089 will provide about 4 dBi of gain independent of the orientation (horizontal or vertical) of the UR2. When using two linearly-polarized antennas, a significant loss in signal can be obtained if the transmitter and receiver antennas are not oriented in the same direction (both vertical for example). To mitigate this we recommend that diversity antennas each be tilted 45 degrees away from each other. This also imparts about 3 dB of polarization mismatch loss, but will reduce the chances of signal loss from cross polarization."}, {"question": "The User Guide for Microphone Drum Mount A56D doesn't show where to install Lock Nuts 31A1857 and 31B1770.

What DSCP values do Shure Dante-enabled devices use for audio and clock traffic?", "answer": "Answer\nQOS, or Quality of Service, is a feature of most managed network switches which allows you to prioritize some network traffic over other traffic. In Dante and AES67 networks, we use QOS to ensure that clock and audio traffic is treated deferentially compared to any other traffic on the network. Audio networks rely on packets arriving reliably, in order, and in at regular intervals. Enabling QOS on a switch ensures that this happens to the best of the network's ability.\n\nHow QOS Works\nOn a switch without QOS enabled, frames received by the switch from a source device get deposited into a receive queue to be processed. As the receive queue gets emptied by the switch frame-by-frame, the switch checks its MAC Address or IGMP Snooping table to find which device(s) the frame is intended for based on its destination address. The switch then takes the frame, places it into a transmit queue for the destination device(s), and one by one it forwards (sends) the frames to the destination device. These queues are required because only one frame can be sent or received at one time.\n\nOn a switch with QOS enabled, the switch will prioritize traffic according to the rules you configure--that is, the switch will forward prioritized frames faster than other frames. It does this by setting up multiple transmit queues for each port. Higher priority traffic is placed into higher priority queues, and the higher priority queues are emptied (sent) before lower priority queues. Switches can use different algorithms to do this; we prefer Strict Priority, which ensures that high priority traffic is always sent as quickly as possible.\n\nDSCP Values\nThere are multiple ways to indicate which traffic should be prioritized, but audio over IP systems typically use the DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point) value in the IP packet header to set the priority level. Each source of traffic will include the correct priority level in this field, and we configure the switch to trust the incoming values are valid and accurate. We then map specific DSCP values to specific queues in the order we want. Most switches support either four or eight queues, and we place clock traffic into the highest queue, audio traffic into the second highest queue, video traffic into the third highest queue, and all other traffic into the lowest priority queue. This system only works in environments where we trust the sending equipment to set the correct values, and not just mark ALL of its traffic as highest priority.\n\nThe DSCP values commonly used in audio networks are:\nDSCP56 (CS7)\nDante clock traffic\nAES67 clock traffic from a Dante device running Dante firmware 3.x\nDSCP46 (EF, or Expedited Forwarding)\nDante audio traffic (unicast and multicast)\nAES67 audio traffic from a Dante device running Dante firmware 3.x\nAES67 clock traffic from a Dante device running Dante firmware 4.x*\nAES67 clock traffic from most AES67 standard-compliant devices.\nDSCP34 (AF41)\nAES67 audio traffic from a Dante device running Dante firmware 4.x*\nAES67 audio traffic from most AES67 standard-compliant devices.\n* Shure firmware which adds DDM support contains Dante firmware 4.x and use these DSCP Values. Shure devices without DDM support use Dante firmware 3.x and use the Dante 3.x set of DSCP values.\n\nAudinate publishes their list of QOS parameters in their article How does Dante use DSCP / Diffserv priority values when configuring QoS."}, {"question": "What do I need for a single standalone Stem device setup?", "answer": "Answer\nYou can configure a Stem Table or Wall as a standalone device.

The KSE1500 maximum SPL (sound pressure level) is around 113dBSPL; this is the overall loudness of the system before distortion occurs. The total obtainable SPL is a function of the input level of the signal provided to the KSE1500 and of the amplification provided within the KSE1500.  \n\nIf an audio track is quiet, one might increase the volume toward the maximum setting of 25.  If an audio track provides a robust signal on the KSE1500 input meter, one will likely be using a setting of around 17 or 18.\n\nNote that it is not recommended to drive the KSM1500 from another headphone amplifier."}, {"question": "Is there a technical paper which explains the acoustical concepts of the Unidyne III microphone?", "answer": "Answer\nYes.

Here is an exceptional 1938 article about microphone technology.\n\n\"Microphones Explained for Beginners\"\n\nPublished August 1938 in \"Radio-Craft\" magazine\n\n[\"Radio-Craft\" was published from 1929 through 1953. Copyright is acknowledged.]\n\nThe five most common types of microphones used for Public Address systems and broadcast radio studio work are: carbon, crystal, condenser, ribbon/velocity, and dynamic/moving coil. Each one has its advantages and disadvantages and we shall consider each type in the order named.\n\nCarbon button microphones were used in Alexander Graham Bell's first production model telephones. He bought the patent from inventor Emile Berliner because they were superior to Bell's own liquid element microphones.  A crystal microphones utilizes piezoelectric properties of a crystal for generating electrical signals.  A condenser microphone has a transducer element that includes an integral variable capacitor. A ribbon microphone is operationally simple and inherently bidirectional. A moving coil dynamic microphone is more rugged than other microphones types and not as prone to operational difficulty from weather.\n\nCarbon Microphones\n\nThe carbon microphone depends for its operation on the varying resistance of a carbon element when subjected to varying pressure. The usual arrangement of this type unit, for best fidelity, consists of two carbon buttons one on either side of the diaphragm. This metal diaphragm - in a properly-built carbon microphone - is stretched and air damped so that the effects of self-resonance vibrations are negligible, giving a reasonably uniform output at all ordinary audio frequencies.\n\nThis unit has the disadvantage of a background noise called \"carbon hiss,\" which is caused by the passage of current through the granules. It has a high maintenance factor and must be handled with care. On the other hand it has the advantage of a very good power output level of -30 dB, together with low output impedance, making it possible to have the microphone some distance from the amplifier.\n        Crystal Microphones\n\nTwo types of crystal microphones are in common use today, to wit: 1) the sound-cell type in which the sound waves act directly upon the crystal; and 2) the diaphragm type which uses a diaphragm to which the crystal is attached by means of a mechanical link. In either of these units, the principle of operation depends upon the piezoelectric effect or voltage produced in certain crystals when subjected to mechanical stress, bending, stretching, etc.\n\nThe sound-cell unit is an assembly of two \"bimorph\" Rochelle salt crystal elements in a Bakelite frame. The bimorph elements, in turn, are each made up of two crystal plates with electrodes attached, cemented together so that an applied sound will cause a bending of the assembly, and produce a voltage. The mounting is such that mechanical shocks have little effect on the unit.  No diaphragm is used as the sound impulses actuate the crystal elements directly. An exceptionally wide frequency range, even into the super-audible band and on down to zero frequency, may be obtained from this unit. Of the two types of crystal microphones, the sound-cell has the better frequency characteristics. Its output is very low, however, so it requires greater amplification. This type of crystal microphone is usually employed for full-range musical pick-up.\n  The diaphragm type will give much greater output, eliminating in most cases the need for a preamplifier, but it has the disadvantage of limited frequency response. This type of crystal microphone is most used for voice work.\n \n\nCondenser Microphones\n\nThe diaphragm of the condenser microphone constitutes one of the plates of a variable air condenser, while the back plate, which is separated from the diaphragm by a film of air about 1/1,000 inch thick, acts as the other plate. Capacity variations of this condenser, in series with coupling condenser, develop minute audio frequency voltages which are then amplified by a one- or two-stage \"head\" amplifier. In actual practice, the condenser and head amplifier (or preamplifier) are all housed in the same case and the whole unit is called a condenser microphone.\n\nAfter the signal leaves the head amplifier, it has about the same output level as that of a double-button carbon type. The same principle of stretching and damping the diaphragm is applied to the condenser type as is used in the carbon microphone, thus giving about the same fidelity of output. However, there is a noticeable absence of background hiss, and the ruggedness of the unit is a decided advantage.\n    Ribbon Microphones\n\nThe ribbon microphone is so named because the armature is a light corrugated ribbon of aluminum alloy. This type is also called a velocity microphone because the voltage induced in the ribbon is proportional to the instantaneous velocity of the air in the sound wave. The aluminum ribbon is suspended in the field of a permanent magnet and when sound waves strike the ribbon it vibrates, cutting the magnetic lines of force.\n\nWhenever a moving conductor cuts lines of magnetic force, a voltage is induced in the conductor. Thus in this case we will have set up in the ribbon a small voltage whenever it vibrates. Since the mass of the ribbon is extremely low, an excellent frequency response is obtained, extending well beyond the upper limits of the regular stretched-diaphragm-type microphone. This extended range of audio response is not very important as far as speech is concerned but does add brilliance to the reproduction of sound from musical instruments.\n\nThe output of this unit is approximately the same as that of a condenser-type microphone, so it also requires a two-stage amplifier to bring the output level up to about -30 dB.\n\nThe ribbon microphone is a low-impedance device, but it always has a coupling transformer mounted right in the microphone case. By matching the line impedance to that of this coupling transformer, the amplifier may be located some distance from the unit itself, provided the connecting cable is properly shielded.\n\nThis type microphone is of a rugged nature and also possesses a very marked directional effect, the greatest response being obtained at right-angles to the plane of the ribbon. An \"acoustical labyrinth\" is sometimes provided to enhance the directional characteristic by absorbing 1/2 of the rear sound wave. The construction of the ribbon microphone is of such a nature that its operation is very quiet and free from noise or hiss.\n    Dynamic Microphones\n\nThe operation of the moving coil or dynamic microphone, like the dynamic loudspeaker, is fundamentally that of a conductor moving in a magnetic field, thus generating a voltage in the conductor. The diaphragm is made of thin duralumin which - in a high-grade unit - is pressed into a dome shape for stiffening to obtain a piston action over the audio frequency range. Improved frequency response is achieved by providing an \"air passage\" to afford outlet for the rear sound wave.\n\nThe moving coil is made from thin aluminum ribbon cemented to the diaphragm, and moves in the air gap between the pole pieces. The permanent magnet is composed of cobalt alloy steel, which will remain magnetized for a long period of time.\n\nThe moving coil microphone is quite rugged and is not affected by climatic conditions. Its output level is approximately 10 dB higher than that of the condenser-type microphone, or about -80 dB.\n\nThe low impedance of the dynamic microphone makes it possible to locate the preamplifier some distance from the microphone itself. The frequency characteristic of the dynamic microphone is quite uniform from 35 to 10,000 cycles, so it has very good fidelity response to sound in the normal audio range. This type unit has no inherent noise, and due to its very rugged construction can stand quite a bit of rough handling.\n  This article has been prepared from data supplied by courtesy of Coyne Electrical School."}, {"question": "Does Shure or any other company make an on-off switch that can be accessed by foot?
